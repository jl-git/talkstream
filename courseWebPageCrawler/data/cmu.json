Of particular interest are autoregressive point processes, in which observations consist of the times at which each node participates in some event or activity. Such data is common in spike train observations of biological neural networks, interactions within a social network, and pricing changes within financial networks.\u00a0 However, very little is known about how many events must be recorded before we may accurately infer the underlying autoregressive models.\u00a0\n\n\nI will describe sparsity-regularized methods and associated performance bounds which provide new insight into the sample complexity of these problems in high dimensions.\u00a0 While sparsity-regularization is well-studied in the statistics and machine learning communities, common assumptions from that literature (such as the restricted eigenvalue condition) are difficult to verify in this setting because of the correlations and heteroscedasticity of the observations.\u00a0 A novel analysis method leveraging a combination of Martingale concentration inequalities and high-dimensional linear regression characterizes how much data must be collected to ensure reliable inference depending on the size and sparsity of the autoregressive parameters, and these bounds are supported by several empirical studies.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nRebecca Willett is an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Fellow of the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery with an affiliate appointment in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Transition-based models use a transition system, or abstract state machine, to model structured prediction problems, for example syntactic dependency parsing, as a sequence of actions. We propose a technique for learning representations of these states. Our primary innovation is a new control structure for sequence-to-sequence neural networks: the stack LSTM. Like the conventional stack data structures used in transition-based parsing, elements can be pushed to or popped from the top of the stack in constant time, but, in addition, an LSTM maintains a continuous space embedding of the stack contents. This lets us formulate efficient transition-based natural language processing models that captures three facets of the state: (i) unbounded look-ahead into the buffer of incoming words, (ii) the complete history of transition actions taken, and (iii) the complete contents of the stack of partially built fragments, including their internal structures.\n\n\nWe also discuss different approaches to word representations, by modeling words and by modeling characters. The latter improves the way of handling out of vocabulary words without using external resources and improves the performance in morphologically rich languages. Transition-based modeling for natural language processing is not limited to syntactic parsing. In this talk I will explain how we successfully applied Stack-LSTMs to dependency parsing, phrase-structure parsing, language modeling and named entity recognition with outstanding results.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nMiguel Ballesteros is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Pompeu Fabra University, in Barcelona (Spain).

Based on this inevitable urbanization, my research aims to address sustainability challenges related to urban mobility (e.g., energy consumption and traffic congestion) by data-driven applications with a Cyber-Physical-Systems approach (CPS, also known as a broader term for Internet of Things), which is a new information paradigm integrating communication, computation and control in real time. Under the context of a smart cities initiative proposed by the White House, in this talk, I will focus on CPS related to large-scale cross-domain urban systems, e.g., taxi, bus, subway, cellphone and smart payment systems.\n\n\nI will first show how cross-domain data from these systems can be collaboratively utilized to capture urban mobility in real time by a new technique called multi-view bounding, which addresses overfitting issues of existing mobility models driven by single-domain data. Then I will show how the captured real-time mobility can be used to design a practical service, i.e., mobility-driven ridesharing, to provide positive feedback to urban systems themselves, e.g., reducing energy consumption and traffic congestion. Finally, I will present real-world impact of my research and some future work about CPS for smart cities.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nDesheng Zhang is a Research Associate at Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the University of Minnesota.

However, unlike linear and quadratic program- ming, general convex solvers have not yet reached sufficient maturity to fully decouple the convex programming model from the numerical algorithms required for implementation. Especially as datasets grow in size, there is a significant gap in speed and scalability between general solvers and specialized algorithms\n\n\nThis thesis addresses this gap with a new model for convex programming based on an intermediate representation of convex problems as a sum of functions with ef- ficient proximal operators. This representation serves two purposes: 1) many problems can be expressed in terms of functions with simple proximal operators, and 2) the proximal operator form serves as a general interface to any specialized algorithm that can incorporate additional l2-regularization. On a single CPU core, numerical results demonstrate that the prox-affine form results in significantly faster algorithms than existing general solvers based on conic forms. In addition, splitting problems into separable sums is attractive from the perspective of distributing solver work amongst multiple cores and machines.\n\n\nWe apply large-scale convex programming to several problems arising from building the next-generation, information-enabled electrical grid. In these problems (as is common in many domains) large, high-dimensional datasets present opportunities for novel data-driven solutions. We present approaches based on convex models for several problems: probabilistic forecasting of electricity generation and demand, preventing failures in microgrids and source separation for whole-home energy disaggregation.\n\n\nThesis Committee:J.

In this thesis, I argue that this this low security sensitivity can partially be explained by the fact that traditional security and privacy behaviors can have myriad social consequences. For example, by using two-factor authentication, one might also be perceived as \u201cparanoid\u201d or as someone with something to hide. Yet, to date, little theoretical work in usable privacy and security has applied social science theory to understand how these potential social consequences affect people\u2019s security sensitivity. Likewise, little systems work in usable privacy and security has considered the social consequences of security tool designhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/, nor have many security tools been developed with social principles in mind.\n\n\nTo bridge this gap in the literature, I will begin to build a theory of social cybersecurity and apply these theoretical insights to create interventions and security tools that improve people\u2019s security sensitivity. Specifically, through a series of observational studies, I will construct both qualitative and quantitative models of behavior to explore how and why social factors influence security sensitivity and, in turn, the diffusion of security tool adoptions through a social network. I will then conduct a series of random experiments to test if these these observational insights can be leveraged to enhance security sensitivity. I will then distill these observational and experimental results into a set of concrete design guidelines and recommendations for the effective use of social influence to increase security sensitiviy and to improve security and privacy tools. Finally, to begin exploring the design space of social cybersecurity systems, I will design, implement, and evaluate a socially compatible security system, Thumprint. In a field deployment, I will use Thumprint as a design probe to better understand how the introduction of a \u201csocial\u201d cybersecurity system affects security practices and social dynamics.\n\n\nConcretely, this thesis will provide the following contributions: (i) an initial theory of social cybersecurity, developed from both observational and experimental work, that explains how social factors affect people\u2019s security sensitivity\u2014i.e., their awareness of, motivation to use, and knowledge of how to use security tools; (ii) a set of design recommendations for creating better, more socially compatible security and privacy systems; and, (iii) the design, implementation and evaluation of a system that leverages these design recommendations to explore the design space of social cybersecurity systems.\n\n\nThesis Committee: Jason Hong (Chair) Laura Dabbish (Co-chair)Jeffrey Bigham J.D.

The first and more traditional paradigm, using symbolic methods, work by dividing sentences up into small chunks, translating these chunks, and re-combining the chunks into a full sentence translation. The second paradigm, using neural methods, generates the target words one-by-one according to a probabilistic model that considers the source sentence and the previous words in the target.\n\n\nFirst, I will overview the symbolic methods, specifically focusing on our work on syntax-based MT that has allowed us to achieve state-of-the-art results on language pairs with very different word orders. Given this background, I will describe neural MT, contrasting it to the more traditional symbolic methods, and showing results demonstrating the relatively new neural MT paradigm's enormous potential, but also pointing out some quirks that seriously impact its usability in real MT applications. Finally, I will present a new technique that we have recently developed to incorporate information from symbolic models into neural models, and describe ongoing work to use this and similar techniques to create neural MT systems that are as flexible and reliable as their symbolic counterparts.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nGraham Neubig am currently an assistant professor at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) Graduate School of Information Science, affiliated with the Augmented Human Communication Laboratory.\u00a0 I completed my PhD at Kyoto University in 2013 with Prof. Tatsuya Kawahara.\u00a0 \n\n\nMy research focuses on handling human languages (like English or Japanese) with computers, so called natural language processing.\u00a0 In particular, I am interested in machine learning approaches that are both linguistically motivated and tailored to applications such as machine translation and speech recognition.\u00a0 I like developing and have created open-source software.\u00a0 I also have had a chance to give tutorials and talks on subjects such as machine translation, neural networks, and language modeling. \n\n\nFaculty Host: Alan Black\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nSCSFC    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\nmaryjob [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-03-04 10:00:00-05:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-03-04-1000/scs-faculty-candidate-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Director, Newman Laboratory for BIomechanics and Human Rehabilitation    ", "Speaker": "NEVILLE HOGAN    ", "Description": "Seminars    \n  \n        \nNEVILLE HOGAN    \n  \n        \nProfessor of Mechanical Engineering, Brain and Cognitive Sciences    \n  \n        \nDirector, Newman Laboratory for BIomechanics and Human Rehabilitation    \n  \n        \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology    \n  \n        \nThe Paradox of Human Performance    \n  \n        \nFriday, March 18, 2016 - \n3:30pm to 4:30pm    \n  \n        \nMauldin Auditorium 1305\u00a0    \n  \n        \nNewell-Simon Hall    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nHuman dexterity and agility vastly exceed that of contemporary robots. Yet humans have vastly slower \u2018hardware\u2019 (e.g. muscles) and \u2018wetware\u2019 (e.g. neurons). How can this paradox be resolved? Slow actuators and long communication delays require predictive control based on some form of internal model\u2014but what form? I will argue that a plausible answer is based on dynamic primitives; they enable highly dynamic behavior with minimal high-level supervision and intervention. Controlling physical interaction requires mechanical impedance to be among the classes of dynamic primitives. I will review how pre-computing appropriate mechanical impedance may be cast as an optimization problem, provided the objective function includes both force and motion at an interaction port. To combine both motion and interaction primitives, I propose a nonlinear generalization of the classical equivalent circuit. It reconciles contrasting constraints of information-processing (computation) and energy-processing (physical dynamics). I suggest that nonlinear equivalent networks provide a general basis for the internal models required for high-performance interactive control.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nNeville Hogan is Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Director of the Newman Laboratory for Biomechanics and Human Rehabilitation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Supply chains decrease development risk, but typically at the cost of increased security risk. In particular, it is often difficult to trust or verify that a component contains no unwanted behaviors, vulnerabilities, or malicious code that may harm an application or its users.\n\n\nSandboxes provide relief by encapsulating a component and imposing a security policy on it. Instead of trusting or verifying the component, we must trust or verify the relatively simple sandbox. Given this appealing prospect, researchers have spent decades developing new sandboxes. However, sandboxes are rarely used in practice. What is hampering adoption? This thesis advances our understanding of and overcomes some barriers to adoption.\n\n\nWe begin by systematically analyzing a decade of sandboxing research from relevant top-tier conferences. This work uncovers our first two challenges: sandbox researchers often (1) use relatively subjective validation techniques and (2) ignore usability.\n\n\nWe then focus on the Java sandbox to empirically study its use within the open source community. We find unnecessary complexity in the sandbox that has promoted a thriving exploit landscape. We develop run time monitors for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that disable these complexity points, stopping sandbox escaping exploits without breaking compatibility with benign applications. However, we found no cases where the sandbox was successfully used for security purposes, which motivated us to overcome necessary complexity via tooling. Our tools help users derive and refine a security policy and impose it on targeted Java application components.\n\n\nFinally, we observe vulnerability-inducing design and implementation complexity in adopted sandboxes, and thus develop and evaluate a sandboxing technique that leverages cloud computing environments to execute untrusted computations. Any malicious outcomes produced by the computations are contained by ephemeral virtual machines.\n\n\nWe evaluate our tools and sandbox in a series of case studies that investigate hard-to-sandbox cases in collaboration with industrial partners.\n\n\nThesis Committee:Jonathan Aldrich (Co-chair) William L.

Data-independent memory-hard functions are defined by fixing a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\u00a0G on n nodes which represents the dependence between the inputs and outputs of n\u00a0 calls to an underlying compression function H. Ideally we would like that to compute an iMHF (even allowing parallel calls to\u00a0H) the cumulative computational resources required should be\u00a0Omega(n^2). That is either the sum of the amount of memory used at each time step should be at least\u00a0Omega(n^2) or the total number of queries to\u00a0H should be at least Omega(n^2). In this work we demonstrate attacks on iMHFs based on three classes of DAGs each using o(n^2) resources. In particular we get that:\n\n\n(1) The Catena-Dragonfly iMHF can be computed by an algorithm with cumulative complexity O(n^{1.67}). Similarly, the cumulative complexity of the newer Catena-Butterfly iMHF is O(n^{1.67}).\n\n\n(2) The Argon2i iMHF (winner of the Password Hashing Competition) can be computed by an algorithm with cumulative complexity O(n^{7/4}\\log(n)).\n\n\n(3) Any iMHF can be computed by an algorithm with cumulative complexity O(n^2/\\log^{1-\\epsilon}(n)) for all epsilon > 0.\n\n\nAt a technical level we provide a general attack against any iMHF defined by a DAG $G=(V,E)$ that is not depth-robust, meaning that we can find a ``small' set $S\\subset V$ of nodes such that $G-S$ does not contain a ``long' path. \u00a0We demonstrate that the Catena and Argon2i DAGs are not depth robust in an extreme sense. Furthermore, no simple DAG (constant indegree) is sufficiently depth robust to resist an attack with cumulative complexity\u00a0 O(n^2/\\log^{1-\\epsilon}(n)). This shows that the goal of constructing an iMHF requiring Omega(n^2) cumulative resources is unachievable.\n\n\nJoint work with Joel Alwen (IST Austria)\n\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\n\n\u00a0\n    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\nnlc [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-03-25 10:30:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-03-25-1030/computer-science-distinguished-lecture", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Exploiting the Environment to Improve Autonomy: Robots in Geophysical Flows    ", "Speaker": "M.

While the tight-coupling between vehicle and environment dynamics makes control challenging, it provides a unique opportunity for robots to exploit the environmental forces to improve and prolong their autonomy. In this talk, I'll show the limitations of existing air and ground based strategies and present our efforts in improving vehicle autonomy by better understanding the dynamics of the geophysical fluid environment. The talk will describe our efforts in using robot teams to track coherent structures. Coherent structures are of great importance since they give us a way to map and represent the dynamics of the fluid environment. I will then show how this information can then be exploited to develop more efficient control and coordination strategies for networks of AUVs/ASVs operating in these environments.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nM. .
