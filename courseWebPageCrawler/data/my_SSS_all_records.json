He believes that these three trends, taken together, give us the ability to shift to an entirely new set of design and business paradigms\u00a0for the first time in our history. The way we design for things, when they begin to wake up, is uncharted territory. If we don\u2019t take into account our connected future and continue to design for disconnected things, we will design our way into irrelevance. The challenge we as designers face is how we surf these trends, what we do about them, and how the act of designing 'things' will change. Those of us that figure it out sooner rather than later will have an unfair advantage, while others will be reactionary and surprised at each turn of the screw.\n\n\nMickey and his team hope some of us can not only survive the riptide, but also harness its power for good.\u00a0Please join Mickey in a discussion about Primordial, ecological design and the nature of things.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nMickey McManus is a research fellow at Autodesk in the Office of the\u00a0CTO,\u00a0and Principal & Chairman of the board at\u00a0MAYA\u00a0Design, a design consultancy and innovation lab.

This stands in contrast to the classical setting of one-way communication in which error-correcting codes are known to achieve an optimal communication rate of 1-Theta(H(eps)) = 1 - Theta(eps*log(1/eps)).\n\n\nIn this work, we show that the quadratically smaller rate loss of the one-way setting can also be achieved in interactive coding schemes for a very natural class of input protocols. We introduce the notion of average message length, or the average number of bits a party sends before receiving a reply, as a natural parameter for measuring the level of interactivity in a protocol. Moreover, we show that any protocol with average message length l = Omega(poly(1/eps)) can be simulated, with high probability, by a longer protocol with an optimal communication rate of 1-Theta(H(eps)) over an oblivious adversarial channel with error fraction eps.\n\n\nThis shows that the capacity gap between one-way and interactive communication can be bridged even for very small (constant in eps) average message lengths, which is very likely to be found in many applications. \n\n\nJoint work with Bernhard Haeupler.\n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement.\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/mon-2016-04-25-1200/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Bridging the Capacity Gap Between Interactive and One-Way Communication    ", "Speaker": "AMEYA VELINGKER    ", "Time": "2016-04-25 12:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Seminars    \n  \n        \nYEZHOU YANG    \n  \n        \nPostdoctoral Research Associate    \n  \n        \nInstitute for Advanced Computer Studies    \n  \n        \nUniversity of Maryland, College Park    \n  \n        \nHuman Manipulation Action Understanding for Cognitive Robots    \n  \n        \nMonday, May 2, 2016 - \n3:00pm to 4:00pm    \n  \n        \n1507\u00a0    \n  \n        \nNewell-Simon Hall    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nModern intelligent agents will need to learn the manipulation actions that humans perform. They will need to recognize these actions when they see them and they will need to perform these actions themselves. The lesson from the findings on mirror neurons is that the two processes of interpreting visually observed action and generating actions, should share the same underlying cognitive process. The talk will present a cognitive system that interprets human manipulation actions from perceptual information (image and depth data) and consists of perceptual modules and reasoning modules that are in interaction with each other.\n\n\nThe talk focuses on two core problems at the heart of manipulation action understanding: a) the grounding of relevant information about actions in perception (the perception - action integration problem), and b) the organization of perceptual and high-level symbolic information for interpreting the actions (the sequencing problem). At the high level, actions are represented with the Manipulation Action Context-free Grammar (MACFG), a syntactic grammar and associated parsing algorithms, which organizes actions as a sequence of sub-events. Each sub-event is described by the hand (as well as grasp type), movements (actions) and the objects and tools involved, and the relevant information about these quantities is obtained from biologically inspired perception modules. These modules recognize the hand grasp, manipulation action consequences and object-wise spatial primitives. Furthermore, a probabilistic semantic parsing framework based on CCG (Combinatory Categorial Grammar) theory is adopted to model the semantic meaning of human manipulation actions.\n\n\nAnalogically, understanding manipulation actions is like understanding language, while executing them is like generating language. Experiments on two tasks, 1) a robot observing people performing manipulation actions, and 2) a robot then executing manipulation actions accordingly, are conducted to validate the formalism.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nDr. Yezhou Yang is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Computer Vision Lab and the Automation, Robotics and Cognition (ARC) Lab, with the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, working with his PhD advisors: Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos and Dr. Cornelia Fermuller.

From insects to mammals, the ability to sense regular patterns has a neurobiological basis and has been observed in many levels of intelligence and behavior. From Felix Klein\u02bcs Erlanger program, D\u2019Arcy Thompson\u2019s Growth-and-Form, to the Gestalt principles of perception, much of our understanding of the world is based on the perception and recognition of repeated patterns, generalized by the mathematical concept of symmetry and symmetry groups. Given the ubiquity of symmetry in both the physical and the digital worlds, a computational model for symmetry-based regularity perception is especially pertinent to computer vision, computer graphics, and machine intelligence in general, where an intelligent being (e.g. a robot) seeks to perceive, reason and interact with the chaotic world in the most effective and efficient manner. Surprisingly, we have limited knowledge on how humans perceive regular patterns and little progress has been made in computational models for noisy, albeit near-regular patterns in real data. In this talk, I present parallels as well as differences between machine perception and human perception of visual regularity. I shall report our recent results on understanding human perception of wallpaper patterns using neuroimaging (EEG, fMRI), and our successful attempt at building a symmetry-based Turing test to tell humans and robots apart.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nYanxi Liu received her B.S. degree in physics/electrical engineering (Beijing, China), her Ph.D. degree in computer science for group theory applications in robotics (University of Massachusetts, Amherst, US), and her postdoctoral training in the robotics lab of LIFIA/IMAG (Grenoble, France).

Unfortunately poor conditioning of the eigendecomposition operation often causes the performance of spectral clustering to suffer in the presence of noise.\n\n\nAim: In this work we aim to develop a noise-robust spectral clustering algorithm.\n\n\nMethod: We show that the notion of diffusion can be used to identify and reduce the weight of noisy edges in the similarity matrix. We propose a new iterative algorithm consisting of three key steps: A diffusion step, a thresholding step, and a normalization step. By iterating these 3 steps we drive noisy edges to zero, denoising the adjacency matrix. We call this algorithm Iterative Diffusion Reweighting (IDR).\n\n\nResults: We apply IDR to 2 datasets: The Utah Teapot dataset and a geotagged twitter dataset. We show that in both cases IDR outperforms alternative approaches. In the case of the Utah Teapot we show that IDR can recover a planted manifold in the presence of noise that alternative approaches cannot. In the case of the geotagged twitter dataset we show that IDR results in a superior clustering.\n\n\nConclusion: We show that an iterative diffusion based algorithm can be used to improve the performance of spectral clustering in the presence of noise by denoising the adjacency matrix.\n\n\nDAP Committee:  Geoff Gordon, Aarti Singh, Roy Maxion\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nMLD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-22-1700/machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-vi", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "  Noise-Robust Spectral Clustering     ", "Speaker": "CARLTON DOWNEY    ", "Time": "2016-04-22 17:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Project Presentations    \n  \n        \nNICOLE RAFIDI    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nMachine Learning Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \n The Role of Syntax in Semantic Processing: a Study of Active and Passive Voicings    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 22, 2016 - 3:30pm    \n  \n        \n8102\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nBackground: As you read this sentence, you are performing the complex task of composing the meaning of these words into a whole proposition. Work in psycholinguistics has shown that humans use both the semantics (the meaning of the words) and the syntax (their order) of a sentence to process its meaning. However, way the brain combines this information are largely unknown. High temporal resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) can help answer this question, because they measure neural activity on the timescale of natural reading.\n\n\nAim: We apply classifiers to MEG data that track when particular words are decodable from observed neural activity, and are thus presumably accessed by the participant. We contrast sentences with the same semantics and different syntax in order to shed light on the order of operations used by the brain when reading English sentences. We examine the robustness of these results to various design choices to maximize sensitivity in future confirmatory analyses.\n\n\nData: We collected MEG data while 8 participants read active- and passive-voiced versions of the same propositions. There were 16 propositions made up of 8 nouns and 4 verbs. The 32 sentences were repeated 15 times and we use an average of some or all of these repetitions for subsequent analysis.\n\n\nMethods: We apply a Naive Bayes classifier at each point in the MEG activity timeseries to generate classification accuracy timeseries for each word in the sentence, cross-validating in a leave-one-proposition-out manner. We seek time windows of above chance accuracy in order to assert when certain words are accessed. To test the robustness of the observed effect, we vary different aspects of the data analysis and observe the effect on decoding accuracy.\n\n\nConclusions: This result is consistent with prior work demonstrating reanalysis in syntactically complex sentences, in which participants correct an erroneous initial reading of the sentence. Our work newly elucidates the timing and mechanism of reanalysis, which is late in the sentence and consistent with theory on the mental storage of sentence components by role. Via reanalysis, participants can arrive at the same meaning through different syntactic paths.\n\n\nDAP Committee: Tom Mitchell, John Anderson, Roy Maxion\n    \n  \n        \nPostesr    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nMLD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-22-1530/machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-v", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": " The Role of Syntax in Semantic Processing: a Study of Active and Passive Voicings    ", "Speaker": "NICOLE RAFIDI    ", "Time": "2016-04-22 15:30:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Project Presentations    \n  \n        \nMICOL MARCHETTI-BOWICK    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nMachine Learning Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \n  A Penalized Regression Model for the Joint Estimation of eQTL Associations and Gene Network Structure    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 22, 2016 - 2:00pm    \n  \n        \n8102\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nBackground: A critical task in the study of biological systems is understanding how gene expression is regulated within the cell. This problem is typically divided into multiple separate tasks, including performing eQTL mapping to identify SNP-gene relationships and estimating gene network structure to identify gene-gene relationships. \n\n\n\nAim >: In this work, we pursue a holistic approach to discovering the patterns of gene regulation in the cell. We present a new method for jointly performing eQTL mapping and gene network estimation while encouraging a transfer of information between the two tasks. \n\n\n\nData : We evaluate our approach on both synthetic data and on a real yeast eQTL dataset that contains 1,157 SNP genotypes and 1,409 gene expression measurements for 114 yeast samples.\n\n\n\nMethods : To construct a unified model for jointly performing eQTL mapping and gene network inference, we formulate the problem as a multiple-output regression task in which we aim to learn the regression coefficients while simultaneously estimating the conditional independence relationships among the set of response variables. The approach we develop uses structured sparsity penalties to encourage the sharing of information between the regression coefficients and the output network in a mutually beneficial way. Our new model, inverse-covariance-fused lasso, is formulated as a biconvex optimization problem that we solve via alternating minimization. We derive new, efficient optimization routines to solve each convex sub-problem that are based on existing state-of-the-art methods.\n\n\nResults: Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our approach outperforms a large number of existing methods on the recovery of the true sparse structure of both the eQTL associations and the gene network.\n\n\nConclusions : We show that inverse-covariance-fused lasso can be used to perform joint eQTL mapping and gene network estimation on a yeast dataset, yielding more biologically coherent results than previous work. Furthermore, the same problem setting appears in many different applications, and therefore our model can be deployed in a wide range of domains.\n\n\nDAP Committee:  Eric Xing, Jian Ma, Roy Maxion \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nMLD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-22-1400/machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-iv", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "8102\u00a0    ", "Speaker": "  A Penalized Regression Model for the Joint Estimation of eQTL Associations and Gene Network Structure    ", "Time": "2016-04-22 14:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Project Presentations    \n  \n        \nAVINAVA DUBEY    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nMachine Learning Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nDynamic Hierarchical Clustering for Data Exploration    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 22, 2016 - 12:30pm    \n  \n        \n8102\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nBackground: Hierarchical clustering methods offer an intuitive and powerful way to model and explore a wide variety of data sets. However, the assumption of a fixed hierarchy is often overly restrictive as the hierarchy may evolve when working with data generated over a period of time. Due to this restriction, existing methods that can only learn static hierarchies and are unable to model hierarchies that evolve over time.\n\n\nAim: In my DAP I aim to overcome this problem. We expect both the structure of our hierarchy and the parameters of the clusters to evolve with time. To this end we aim to model this evolution of both structure of hierarchy and the parameters over time. Our primary goal in this paper is to show that doing so will lead to better modeling of such data and help us in discovering interesting trends in data.\n\n\nData: We explore three different datasets: (a) 79,800 paper titles from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) between 1915 and 2005, containing 36,901 unique words (b) Presidential State of the Union (SoU) addresses from 1790 through 2002, containing 56,352 sentences and 21,505 unique words (c) 673,102 tweets containing hashtags relevant to the NFL, collected over 18 weeks in 2011 and containing 2,636 unique words.\n\n\nConclusion: The quantitative experiment shows that as compared to baselines our dynamic hierarchical clustering better fits a given dataset and generalizes well to unseen data. We also show that we are able to find interesting trends that have not been seen before in the given datasets. Through our experiments we make a compelling case for using dynamic hierarchical clustering models to explore data generated over a period of time.\n\n\nDAP Committee: Eric Xing, Roy Maxion, Sinead Williamson (UT Austin)\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nMLD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-22-1230/machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-iii", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Dynamic Hierarchical Clustering for Data Exploration    ", "Speaker": "AVINAVA DUBEY    ", "Time": "2016-04-22 12:30:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Project Presentations    \n  \n        \nPENGCHENG ZHOU    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nMachine Learning Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nEstablishing a Statistical Link Between Network Oscillations and Neural Synchrony    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 22, 2016 - 11:00am    \n  \n        \n8102\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nPairs of active neurons frequently fire action potentials or 'spikes' nearly synchronously (i.e., within 5 ms of each other). This spike synchrony may occur by chance, based solely on the neurons' fluctuating firing patterns, or it may occur too frequently to be explicable by chance alone. When spike synchrony above chances levels is present, it may subserve computation for a specific cognitive process, or it could be an irrelevant byproduct of such computation. Either way, spike synchrony is a feature of neural data that should be explained. \n\n\nA point process regression framework has been developed previously for this purpose, using generalized linear models (GLMs). In this framework, the observed number of synchronous spikes is compared to the number predicted by chance under varying assumptions about the factors that affect each of the individual neuron's firing-rate functions. An important possible source of spike synchrony is network-wide oscillations, which may provide an essential mechanism of network information flow. \n\n\nTo establish the statistical link between spike synchrony and network-wide oscillations, we have integrated oscillatory field potentials into our point process regression framework. We first extended a previously-published model of spike-field association and showed that we could recover phase relationships between oscillatory field potentials and firing rates. We then used this new framework to demonstrate the statistical relationship between oscillatory field potentials and spike synchrony in: 1) simulated neurons, 2) in vitro recordings of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and 3) in vivo\u00a0recordings of neocortical V4 neurons. Our results provide a rigorous method for establishing a statistical link between network oscillations and neural synchrony.\n\n\nDAP Committee: Rob Kass, Valerie Ventura, Roy Maxion\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nMLD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-22-1100/machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-ii", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Establishing a Statistical Link Between Network Oscillations and Neural Synchrony    ", "Speaker": "PENGCHENG ZHOU    ", "Time": "2016-04-22 11:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Project Presentations    \n  \n        \nMRINMAYA SACHAN    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nMachine Learning Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nLearning Answer-Entailing Structures for Standardized Tests    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 22, 2016 - 9:30am    \n  \n        \n8102\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nStandardized tests have often been proposed as 'drivers for progress in AI' (Clark et. al. 2016). These include reading comprehension tests (Richardson et. al. 2013), science question answering (Clark et. al. 2015), IQ tests, entrance exams, etc. These tests are widely accessible, easily comprehensible, clearly measurable, and offer a graduated progression from simple tasks to those requiring deep understanding of the world. This makes them perfect testbeds for research in knowledge-driven AI.\n\n\nIn this talk, I\u00a0will describe our approach to solve two of these standardized tests\u00a0 - namely, reading comprehension and elementary science question answering. Both these tests require a significant level of language understanding, background knowledge modeling and reasoning.\u00a0We posit that there is a hidden (latent) structure that explains the relation between the question, the correct answer, and the background texts. We call this the 'answer-entailing structure'; given the structure, the correctness of the answer is evident. Since the structure is latent, it must be inferred.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find these hidden structures (given a corpus of question-answer pairs), and uses what it learns to answer novel questions.\u00a0Evaluation on publicly available datasets shows that our framework of solving standardized tests via latent answer-entailing structures outperforms various IR and neural-network baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art on both these tasks.\n\n\n DAP\u00a0Committee:  Eric Xing, Ed Hovy, Roy Maxion\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nMLD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-22-0930/machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-1", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "8102\u00a0    ", "Speaker": "Learning Answer-Entailing Structures for Standardized Tests    ", "Time": "2016-04-22 09:30:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Seminars    \n  \n        \nJOYCE MUSANTE    \n  \n        \nPrivacy Officer    \n  \n        \nPhilips Respironics    \n  \n        \nThursday, April 21, 2016 - \n12:00pm to 1:30pm    \n  \n        \n1502\u00a0    \n  \n        \nHamburg Hall    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nJoyce Musante, Privacy Officer Philips Respironics, Inc. will provide an overview of what it is like to be a privacy engineer at a global medical device company.\u00a0 She will provide you an overview of:\u00a0\n\nRoyal Philips itself and the Pittsburgh based Sleep and Respiratory Care business;\nHow privacy and security is integral to innovation and product development; and,\nShare some of the strategic privacy issues the health technology business is facing.\n\n\n\nProviding quality service, products, care and health improvement strategies to individuals and the population as a whole \u00a0has been Joyce Musante's passion throughout her career.

They want to get out into the neighborhoods of the city that they are visiting and understand more of the city\u2019s culture and everyday life. However, current guides remained focused on statistics and points, so tourists are unable to understand and find neighborhoods they would enjoy.\n\n\nI propose to build neighborhood guides based on social media posts to help people understand neighborhoods. These guides will have two parts: first, they will allow comparison between neighborhoods in a new city and neighborhoods they know; second, they will add context so travelers can understand why the neighborhoods are similar. These will enable people to understand how different neighborhoods feel, and contribute to our understanding of the city as a whole. Their effectiveness will be evaluated through quantitative studies of the comparisons and qualitative studies of the site as a whole.\n\n\nThis thesis will provide three research contributions. First, it will provide evidence that social media can help us understand cities better than simple demographics. Second, it will show how well social media reflects neighborhoods, and what aspects are best represented. Finally, it will contribute to our knowledge of tourist information search by the development of a five dimensional model.\n\n\nThesis Committee: Jason Hong (Chair)Jodi ForlizziNiki KitturJudd Antin (AirBnB)\n\n\nCopy of Proposal Document\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nHCII", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/thu-2016-04-28-1330/human-computer-interaction-thesis-proposal", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Social Media Neighborhood Guides    ", "Speaker": "DAN TASSE    ", "Time": "2016-04-28 13:30:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Talks    \n  \n        \nLAUREN MILLER    \n  \n        \nPostdoctoral Researcher    \n  \n        \nLaboratory for Automation Science and Engineering    \n  \n        \nUniversity of California, Berkeley    \n  \n        \nOptimal Ergodic Control for Active Information Acquisition    \n  \n        \nThursday, April 21, 2016 - 10:00am    \n  \n        \nASA Conference Room 6115\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nAs robotic and autonomous systems become more ubiquitous and their applications more expansive, the problems we look to solve are often best characterized by desirable statistics or distributions.

Such a mechanism promotes positive connections and helps a social networking site to grow without direct belligerent or negative encounters. This type of one-way connections makes no distinction between indifference and dislike; in other words, two users have only, by default, positive connections. However, it is \u00a0apparent that as one's network grows, some users might not be benevolent toward each other, or negative links could form, though not explicitly stated.

Due to the expense of such rovers, the resulting missions are risk averse. Small, high-cadence, minimalist rovers are poised to break new ground by expanding space exploration capabilities. Whether by decreasing overall mission costs or enabling symbiotic exploration among multiple low-cost rovers, these minimalist rovers can allow missions to be more risk tolerant and more rapidly explore areas previously deemed too treacherous. \n\n\nExisting methods of localization and route determination of planetary rovers are expensive, both in computational time and power requirements. As a result, they are limited in their speed and performance even on today\u2019s large, expensive rovers. The ability to quickly and efficiently estimate a rover\u2019s route becomes even more crucial as the size, mass, computation, and power budgets continue to shrink. A method for inexpensive route determination will enable safer, faster, and smarter navigation of these minimalist rovers. \n\n\nThis research presents a novel approach for computationally efficient visual odometry with an unactuated downward looking monocular fisheye camera which is feasible for minimalist rovers from both a computation and electromechanical configuration standpoint. This new visual odometry approach is combined with a sun compass and pose graph optimization to provide high fidelity route determination.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nEugene Fang is a M.S. student in the Robotics Institute advised by William \u201cRed\u201d Whittaker.

The sun lights planetary features with transient, directional illumination. For concave features like skylight pits, craters, and canyons, this can lead to dark shadows. For all terrain features, the ability to detect interest points and to match them between images is complicated by changing illumination, so seeing planetary features in the best light requires a coordinated dance with the sun as it arcs across the sky.\n\n\nThe research develops a process for planned-view-trajectory model building that converts a coarse model of a terrain feature and knowledge about illumination change and mission parameters into a view trajectory planning problem, plans and executes a view trajectory, and builds a detailed model from the captured images. An understanding of how view and illumination angles affect model quality is reached through controlled lighting laboratory experiments. The planning of view trajectories, (what to image, from where, and at what time), is cast as an OPTWIND, a new vehicle routing problem formulated in the thesis work. Each part of the planned-view-trajectory model building process is examined in detail, with existing tools identified and tested to solve parts of the problem, where appropriate, and new solutions implemented otherwise. The research also demonstrates planned-view-trajectory model building.\n\n\nContributions of the research include development, implementation, and demonstration of planned-view-trajectory model building, experimental determination of factors affecting model quality and formulation of view trajectory planning as a new vehicle routing problem. Datasets for planetary analog terrain and for imaging under directional lighting were also collected, totaling over 25,000 images.\n\n\nThesis CommitteeWilliam L.

To address this problem, we have been exploring the use of Nested Data Parallelism (NDP), and specifically Guy Blelloch's first-order functional language NESL, as a way to raise the level of abstraction for programming GPUs. Preliminary results suggest that NDP can be effectively mapped onto GPUs, but there is significant work required to make this mapping competitive with handwritten GPU code. This talk describes ongoing work on a new compiler for NESL language that generates CUDA code. Specifically, we will describe several aspects of the compiler that address some of the challenges of generating efficient NDP code for GPUS.\n\n\nThis work is joint with Nora Sandler and Joseph Wingerter.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nJohn Reppy is a Professor of Computer Science and a Senior Fellow of the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago.

While recent and ongoing research is supplying tools for the analysis of simple unlabeled data, it is still a challenge to find patterns and anomalies in large labeled datasets, such as time evolving networks. What do real communities identified in big datasets look like? How is their structure affected by their size? How can we find realistic communities in labeled data?\n\n\nThe completed work of this proposal details three related problems in this area. Firstly, we explore the shape and structure of real communities in large networks and we introduce the concept of \u201dhyperbolic communities\u201d, providing two different algorithms for finding such structures in large datasets. Secondly, we find communities in edge-labeled networks, where labels can be timesteps or any other categorical information in general. We describe efficient algorithms for this task. Lastly, we study anomalies in bank transaction networks, where both nodes and edges are labeled. We describe parallel algorithms that automatically find locations where bank accounts were compromised in billion-scale networks.\n\n\nWe also detail future work (1) on the distributed detection of edge-labeled communities, (2) on forecasting communities to the future, predicting what members are going to join and finding the most common community profiles, and (3) on the existence of hyperbolic communities in word-networks, merging community detection and the known heavy-tailed distribution of word frequencies. \n\n\nThesis Committee: Christos Faloutsos (Co-Chair) Pedro Ribeiro (Co-Chair, University of Porto) William Cohen Aarti Singh Tina Eliassi-Rad (Northeastern University) Beatriz Santos (University of Aveiro) Alexandre Francisco (University of Lisbon)\n\n\nCopy of Proposal Summary \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/thu-2016-04-28-1000/computer-science-thesis-proposal", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Communities and Anomalies in Large Edge-Labeled Graphs    ", "Speaker": "MIGUEL ARAUJO    ", "Time": "2016-04-28 10:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Seminars    \n  \n        \nTHOMAS WAHL    \n  \n        \nAssistant Professor    \n  \n        \nCollege of Computer and Information Science    \n  \n        \nNortheatern University    \n  \n        \nBehavioral Non-Portability in Scientific Numeric Computing or: How Floating Point Arithmetic Can Hijack Your Programs    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 29, 2016 - 2:00pm    \n  \n        \nTraffic 21 Classroom 6501\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nThe precise semantics of floating-point arithmetic programs depends on the execution platform, including the compiler and the target hardware.\u00a0 Platform dependencies are particularly pronounced for arithmetic-intensive scientific numeric programs and infringe on the highly desirable goal of software portability (which is in fact promised by heterogeneous computing frameworks like OpenCL): the same program run on the same inputs on different platforms can produce different results.\n\n\nSerious doubts on the portability of numeric applications arise when these differences are behavioral, i.e. when they lead to changes in the control flow of a program. In this talk I will first present an algorithm that takes a numeric procedure and determines whether a given input can lead to different decisions depending merely on how the arithmetic in the procedure is compiled and executed. I will then show how this algorithm can be used in static and dynamic analyses of programs, to estimate their numeric stability. I will illustrate the results on examples characteristic of numeric computing where control flow divergence actually occurs across different execution platforms.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nThomas Wahl joined the faculty of Northeastern University in 2011.

Two domains notorious for their fragility are concurrency and numerical computing. With colleagues, Wahl has developed leading algorithms and techniques that permit the automated analysis of concurrent software such as multi-threaded or data-parallel programs using rigorous formal techniques, which are able to track down deep, unintuitive and nearly untestable program bugs. He has also investigated how floating-point arithmetic can 'hijack' a program's computation when run on non-standard architectures, such as heterogeneous and custom-made embedded platforms.\n\n\nFaculty Host: Andr\u00e9 Platzer\n    \n  \n        \nPOP    \n  \n        \nSeries Website    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nPOP    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\nsdinardo [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-29-1400/principles-programming-seminar", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Behavioral Non-Portability in Scientific Numeric Computing or: How Floating Point Arithmetic Can Hijack Your Programs    ", "Speaker": "THOMAS WAHL    ", "Time": "2016-04-29 14:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Project Presentations    \n  \n        \nMARIA DE ARTEAGA    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nJoint Ph.D. Program in Machine Learning and Public Policy    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nCanonical Autocorrelation Analysis for Radiation Threat Detection    \n  \n        \nWednesday, April 20, 2016 - \n12:00pm to 1:30pm    \n  \n        \n2503\u00a0    \n  \n        \nHamburg Hall    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nRadiation threat detection is an important security challenge for many countries.\u00a0This paper introduces Canonical Autocorrelation Analysis (CAA), a method for finding multiple-to-multiple linear correlations within a single set of features. This can be useful when looking for hidden parsimonious structures in data, each involving only a small subset of all features. The discovered correlations are highly interpretable as they are formed by pairs of sparse linear combinations of the original features. In addition,\u00a0this results in useful visualizations of data.\n\n\nIn this paper\u00a0it is shown how CAA can be of use as a tool for anomaly detection when an expected structure of correlations is not followed by anomalous data. In the case of radiation threat detection, this allows characterization of harmless radiation data based on the patterns across bins of photon counts, and flagging of anomalies where they fail to follow such patterns. The resulting technique performs significantly better than an unsupervised alternative prevalent in the domain, while providing valuable additional insights for threat analysis.\n\n\nDAP Committee: Artur Dubrawski (Advisor) Daniel NagiSimon Labov (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)\n\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nDAP    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/wed-2016-04-20-1200/joint-machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-heinz-first-paper", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Hamburg Hall", "Topic": "Canonical Autocorrelation Analysis for Radiation Threat Detection    ", "Speaker": "MARIA DE ARTEAGA    ", "Time": "2016-04-20 12:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Speaking Skills    \n  \n        \nHANNAH GOMMERSTADT    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nComputer Science Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nMonitoring and Blame Assignment for Higher-Order Session Types     \n  \n        \nFriday, April 22, 2016 - \n12:00pm to 1:00pm    \n  \n        \nTraffic 21 Classroom 6501\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nIn a distributed setting, processes collaborate to complete tasks where each component of the system has some role in the computation. These processes may be written in different languages, and some may be compromised by an attacker. We use session types, types that change as every step of the computation is performed, to prescribe the communication behavior between concurrent message-passing processes. We then use these session types to dynamically monitor the communication between processes to detect undesirable behavior. In this talk, we discuss how to dynamically monitor communication to enforce adherence to session types in a higher-order setting. We present a system of blame assignment in the case when the monitor detects an undesirable action and an alarm is raised. \n\n\nJoint work with Frank Pfenning and Limin Jia. \n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nSCSDay    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-22-1200/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Monitoring and Blame Assignment for Higher-Order Session Types     ", "Speaker": "HANNAH GOMMERSTADT    ", "Time": "2016-04-22 12:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Speaking Skills    \n  \n        \nGURU GURUGANESH    \n  \n        \nPH.D.

The cost incurred by each point is the distance to the furthest point in its cluster, and the cost of the clustering is the sum of all these per-point-costs. This problem is motivated by questions in generating automatic abstractions of extensive-form games.\n\n\nWe reduce this problem to a local k-median problem where each facility has a prescribed radius and can only connect to clients within that radius. Our main results are a constant-factor bicriteria approximation algorithm for the local k-median problem, and hence a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the aversion k-clustering problem. We use a primal-dual approach; our technical contribution is a non-local rounding step which we feel is of broader interest.\n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/wed-2016-04-20-1200/joint-theory-seminarcomputer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Approximation algorithms for aversion k-clustering and local k-median    ", "Speaker": "GURU GURUGANESH    ", "Time": "2016-04-20 12:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Speaking Skills    \n  \n        \nBRUNO VAVALA    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nComputer Science Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nSecuring Passive Replication Through Verification    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 29, 2016 - \n12:00pm to 1:00pm    \n  \n        \nTraffic21 Classroom 6501\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nReplication is a fundamental technique to guarantee service availability and consistency. However, when a system component may misbehave, for instance due to a software intrusion, coordinating its replicas requires the adoption of complex distributed fault-tolerant protocols. In fact, such protocols require several executing replicas and many communication steps to work correctly. This results in redundant service executions that are inefficient and typically force the service to be deterministic so to achieve consistency (i.e., if correct replicas process the same requests in order, they produce the same output). \n\n\nIn this seminar we introduce the concept of hardware-based computation verification in the area of fault-tolerant replication. It is shown how the technique allows to deal with malicious replicas while linearly (in the number of replicas) reducing the computational effort to execute a fault-tolerant distributed service. In particular, we design a fully passive replicated system that dramatically reduces the fault-tolerance complexity, in terms of protocols, number of messages, processing effort and allows non-deterministic operations. Also, we implement a system prototype based on commodity hardware and on recent research work in Trusted Computing (TC). Finally, we show experimentally that our system delivers good performance, compared to optimized state-of-the-art systems, despite its main overhead is due to TC technology.\n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement.\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": "NONE", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-29-1200/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Securing Passive Replication Through Verification    ", "Speaker": "BRUNO VAVALA    ", "Time": "2016-04-29 12:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Project Presentations    \n  \n        \nWednesday, May 4, 2016 - \n10:00am to 5:00pm    \n  \n        \nCohon University Center    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nMeeting of the Minds is a university-wide celebration of undergraduate research.

First, I will introduce a framework for building probabilistic models compositionally out of common modeling motifs, such as clustering, sparsity, and dimensionality reduction. This compositional framework yields a variety of existing models as special cases. We can flexibly perform posterior inference across this large, open-ended space of models by composing sophisticated inference algorithms carefully designed for the individual modeling motifs. An automatic structure search procedure over this space of models yields sensible analyses of datasets as diverse as motion capture, natural image patches, and Senate voting records, all using a single software package with no hand-tuned metaparameters. Applying a similar compositional structure search procedure to Gaussian Process models yields interpretable decompositions of diverse time series datasets and enables automatic generation of natural language reports.  Finally, compositional structure search depends crucially on the estimation of intractable likelihoods. I will briefly outline an approach for obtaining precise likelihood estimates with rigorous tail bounds by sandwiching the true value between stochastic upper and lower bounds.\n\nBio\nRoger Grosse is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the University of Toronto machine learning group.

It will not be available for on-demand viewing.\n  \nFrequent headline-grabbing data breaches suggest that current best practices for safeguarding personal data are woefully inadequate.  To try to move beyond the cycle of attacks and patches we see today, I design and build systems with formal end-to-end guarantees.  For example, to provide strong guarantees for outsourced computations, I developed a new cryptographic framework, verifiable computation, which allows clients to outsource general computations to completely untrusted services and efficiently verify the correctness of each returned result.  Through improvements to the theory and the underlying systems, we reduced the costs of verification by over twenty orders of magnitude.  As a result, verifiable computation is now a thriving research area that has produced several startups, as well as enhancements to the security and privacy of X.509, MapReduce, and Bitcoin.\n\nWhile verifiable computation provides strong guarantees, even the best cryptographic system is useless if implemented badly, applied incorrectly, or used in a vulnerable system.  Thus, I have led a team of researchers and engineers in the Ironclad project, working to expand formal software verification to provide end-to-end guarantees about the security and reliability of complex systems.  By creating a set of new tools and methodologies, Ironclad produced the first complete stack of verified-secure software.  We also recently developed the first methodology for verifying both the safety and liveness of complex distributed systems implementations.  While interesting challenges remain, I expect that verification will fundamentally improve the software that underpins our digital and physical infrastructure.\n\nBio\nBryan Parno is a Researcher in the Security and Privacy Group at Microsoft Research.

While modern hardware is compatible with these goals, modern operating systems remain a bottleneck. Better OS abstractions could significantly improve performance, yet deploying these abstractions has become intractable given the size and complexity of today's systems.\n  \nI will first discuss Dune, a kernel extension that allows OS developers to sidestep software and hardware complexity by running an OS within an ordinary Linux process.  With Dune, developers can both access the capabilities of raw hardware and fall back on the functionality of a full Linux environment where convenient. I will then discuss IX and Shinjuku, two generations of new datacenter-focused operating systems that were enabled by Dune. IX provides a novel system call interface that greatly improves network throughput without sacrificing latency. For example, IX improves Memcached's TCP throughput by 5x over Linux.

It will be taped only for internal UW CSE faculty use.\n\nFuture visual computing applications -- from photorealistic real-time rendering, to 4D light field cameras, to pervasive sensing and computer vision-demand orders of magnitude more computation than we currently have. From data centers to mobile devices, performance and energy scaling is limited by locality (the distance over which data has to move, e.g., from nearby caches, far away main memory, or across networks) and parallelism. Because of this, I argue that we should think of the performance and efficiency of an application as determined not just by the algorithm and the hardware on which it runs, but critically also by the organization of computations and data. For algorithms with the same complexity -- even the exact same set of arithmetic operations and data executing on the same hardware, the order and granularity of execution and placement of data can easily change performance by an order of magnitude because of locality and parallelism. To extract the full potential of our machines, we must treat the organization of computation as a first class concern while working across all levels from algorithms and data structures, to compilers, to hardware.\n\nThis talk will present facets of this philosophy in systems I have built for visual computing applications from image processing and vision, to 3D rendering, simulation, optimization, and 3D printing. I will show that, for data-parallel pipelines common in graphics, imaging, and other data-intensive applications, the organization of computations and data for a given algorithm is constrained by a fundamental tension between parallelism, locality, and redundant computation of shared values. I will focus particularly on the Halide language and compiler for image processing, which explicitly separates what computations define an algorithm from the choices of organization which determine parallelism, locality, memory footprint, and synchronization. I will show how this approach can enable much simpler programs to deliver performance often many times faster than the best prior hand-tuned C, assembly, and CUDA implementations, while scaling across radically different architectures, from ARM cores, to massively parallel GPUs, to FPGAs and custom ASICs.\n\nBio\n\nJonathan Ragan-Kelley is a postdoc in computer science at Stanford.

In this talk, I will discuss strategies to gracefully scale machine learning on modern parallel computational platforms. A common approach to such scaling is coordination-free parallel algorithms, where individual processors run independently without communication, thus maximizing the time they compute. However, analyzing the performance of these algorithms can be challenging, as they often introduce race conditions and synchronization problems.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce a general methodology for analyzing asynchronous parallel algorithms. The key idea is to model the effects of core asynchrony as noise in the algorithmic input.  This allows us to understand the performance of several popular asynchronous machine learning approaches, and to determine when asynchrony effects might overwhelm them.  To overcome these effects, I will propose a new framework for parallelizing ML algorithms, where all memory conflicts and race conditions can be completely avoided. I will discuss the implementation of these ideas in practice, and demonstrate that they outperform the state-of-the-art across a large number of ML tasks on gigabyte-scale data sets.\n\nBio\nDimitris Papailiopoulos is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley and a member of the AMPLab.

Envisioned by Diffie and Hellman already in the 70's as a means of obtaining public-key encryption, it is known by now that this concept may have far reaching implications to cryptography and complexity theory. In particular, program obfuscation suggests (often exclusive) solutions to some of the most challenging privacy and security problems in the age of cloud computing and social networks.\n\nAt the same time, program obfuscation has turned out to be  an evasive goal to achieve, or to even meaningfully define. For a long time, solutions have been confined to heuristics, whereas attempts to achieve any sense of provable security have mostly led to impossibility results. This gloomy state dramatically changed in recent years, when it was shown that a relatively weak notion called indistinguishability obfuscation may be within reach (so far, based on strong computational assumptions) and still has the potential of realizing many dream applications.\n\nIn this talk, I will review the different aspects of obfuscation, including central notions, limitations, and feasibility. As a demonstration of the power of obfuscation, I will present a recent implication [Bitansky-Paneth-Rosen, FOCS15] that goes beyond cryptography into a fundamental problem in complexity and algorithmic game theory -- the hardness of finding a Nash equilibrium.

This is due to the combined effect of breakdowns in transistor scaling, causing severe chip-level power limitations, and monolithic and inefficient general purpose microarchitecture.\n  \nIn this work, I propose and evaluate a concept called \"behavioral specialization\", where the design of general purpose processors is modularized by adding programmable offload engines, each best-suited for different program behaviors or characteristics.
