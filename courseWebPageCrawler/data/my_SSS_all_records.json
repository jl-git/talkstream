This compositional framework yields a variety of existing models as special cases. We can flexibly perform posterior inference across this large, open-ended space of models by composing sophisticated inference algorithms carefully designed for the individual modeling motifs. An automatic structure search procedure over this space of models yields sensible analyses of datasets as diverse as motion capture, natural image patches, and Senate voting records, all using a single software package with no hand-tuned metaparameters. Applying a similar compositional structure search procedure to Gaussian Process models yields interpretable decompositions of diverse time series datasets and enables automatic generation of natural language reports.  Finally, compositional structure search depends crucially on the estimation of intractable likelihoods. I will briefly outline an approach for obtaining precise likelihood estimates with rigorous tail bounds by sandwiching the true value between stochastic upper and lower bounds.\n\nBio\nRoger Grosse is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the University of Toronto machine learning group.

To try to move beyond the cycle of attacks and patches we see today, I design and build systems with formal end-to-end guarantees.  For example, to provide strong guarantees for outsourced computations, I developed a new cryptographic framework, verifiable computation, which allows clients to outsource general computations to completely untrusted services and efficiently verify the correctness of each returned result.  Through improvements to the theory and the underlying systems, we reduced the costs of verification by over twenty orders of magnitude.  As a result, verifiable computation is now a thriving research area that has produced several startups, as well as enhancements to the security and privacy of X.509, MapReduce, and Bitcoin.\n\nWhile verifiable computation provides strong guarantees, even the best cryptographic system is useless if implemented badly, applied incorrectly, or used in a vulnerable system.  Thus, I have led a team of researchers and engineers in the Ironclad project, working to expand formal software verification to provide end-to-end guarantees about the security and reliability of complex systems.  By creating a set of new tools and methodologies, Ironclad produced the first complete stack of verified-secure software.  We also recently developed the first methodology for verifying both the safety and liveness of complex distributed systems implementations.  While interesting challenges remain, I expect that verification will fundamentally improve the software that underpins our digital and physical infrastructure.\n\nBio\nBryan Parno is a Researcher in the Security and Privacy Group at Microsoft Research.

It will be taped only for internal UW CSE faculty use.\n\nFuture visual computing applications -- from photorealistic real-time rendering, to 4D light field cameras, to pervasive sensing and computer vision-demand orders of magnitude more computation than we currently have. From data centers to mobile devices, performance and energy scaling is limited by locality (the distance over which data has to move, e.g., from nearby caches, far away main memory, or across networks) and parallelism. Because of this, I argue that we should think of the performance and efficiency of an application as determined not just by the algorithm and the hardware on which it runs, but critically also by the organization of computations and data. For algorithms with the same complexity -- even the exact same set of arithmetic operations and data executing on the same hardware, the order and granularity of execution and placement of data can easily change performance by an order of magnitude because of locality and parallelism. To extract the full potential of our machines, we must treat the organization of computation as a first class concern while working across all levels from algorithms and data structures, to compilers, to hardware.\n\nThis talk will present facets of this philosophy in systems I have built for visual computing applications from image processing and vision, to 3D rendering, simulation, optimization, and 3D printing. I will show that, for data-parallel pipelines common in graphics, imaging, and other data-intensive applications, the organization of computations and data for a given algorithm is constrained by a fundamental tension between parallelism, locality, and redundant computation of shared values. I will focus particularly on the Halide language and compiler for image processing, which explicitly separates what computations define an algorithm from the choices of organization which determine parallelism, locality, memory footprint, and synchronization. I will show how this approach can enable much simpler programs to deliver performance often many times faster than the best prior hand-tuned C, assembly, and CUDA implementations, while scaling across radically different architectures, from ARM cores, to massively parallel GPUs, to FPGAs and custom ASICs.\n\nBio\n\nJonathan Ragan-Kelley is a postdoc in computer science at Stanford.

In this talk, I will discuss strategies to gracefully scale machine learning on modern parallel computational platforms. A common approach to such scaling is coordination-free parallel algorithms, where individual processors run independently without communication, thus maximizing the time they compute. However, analyzing the performance of these algorithms can be challenging, as they often introduce race conditions and synchronization problems.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce a general methodology for analyzing asynchronous parallel algorithms. The key idea is to model the effects of core asynchrony as noise in the algorithmic input.  This allows us to understand the performance of several popular asynchronous machine learning approaches, and to determine when asynchrony effects might overwhelm them.  To overcome these effects, I will propose a new framework for parallelizing ML algorithms, where all memory conflicts and race conditions can be completely avoided. I will discuss the implementation of these ideas in practice, and demonstrate that they outperform the state-of-the-art across a large number of ML tasks on gigabyte-scale data sets.\n\nBio\nDimitris Papailiopoulos is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley and a member of the AMPLab.

Envisioned by Diffie and Hellman already in the 70's as a means of obtaining public-key encryption, it is known by now that this concept may have far reaching implications to cryptography and complexity theory. In particular, program obfuscation suggests (often exclusive) solutions to some of the most challenging privacy and security problems in the age of cloud computing and social networks.\n\nAt the same time, program obfuscation has turned out to be  an evasive goal to achieve, or to even meaningfully define. For a long time, solutions have been confined to heuristics, whereas attempts to achieve any sense of provable security have mostly led to impossibility results. This gloomy state dramatically changed in recent years, when it was shown that a relatively weak notion called indistinguishability obfuscation may be within reach (so far, based on strong computational assumptions) and still has the potential of realizing many dream applications.\n\nIn this talk, I will review the different aspects of obfuscation, including central notions, limitations, and feasibility.

This results in redundant service executions that are inefficient and typically force the service to be deterministic so to achieve consistency (i.e., if correct replicas process the same requests in order, they produce the same output). \n\n\nIn this seminar we introduce the concept of hardware-based computation verification in the area of fault-tolerant replication. It is shown how the technique allows to deal with malicious replicas while linearly (in the number of replicas) reducing the computational effort to execute a fault-tolerant distributed service. In particular, we design a fully passive replicated system that dramatically reduces the fault-tolerance complexity, in terms of protocols, number of messages, processing effort and allows non-deterministic operations. Also, we implement a system prototype based on commodity hardware and on recent research work in Trusted Computing (TC). Finally, we show experimentally that our system delivers good performance, compared to optimized state-of-the-art systems, despite its main overhead is due to TC technology. \n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": ["2016", "June", "BRUNO", "VAVALA", "Securing", "Passive", "Replication", "Through", "Verification", "Carnegie", "Mellon", "University"], "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/mon-2016-05-02-1330/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Securing Passive Replication Through Verification     ", "Speaker": "BRUNO VAVALA    ", "Time": "2016-05-02 13:30:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Seminars    \n  \n        \nHUANCHEN ZHANG    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nComputer Science Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nReducing the Storage Overhead of Main-Memory OLTP databases with Hybrid Indexes    \n  \n        \nMonday, May 2, 2016 - 10:00am    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nUsing indexes for query execution is crucial for achieving high performance in modern on-line transaction processing databases. For a main-memory database, however, these indexes consume a large fraction of the total memory available and are thus a major source of storage overhead of in-memory databases. To reduce this overhead, we propose using a two-stage index: The first stage ingests all incoming entries and is kept small for fast read and write operations. The index periodically migrates entries from the first stage to the second, which uses a more compact, read-optimized data structure. Our first contribution is hybrid index, a dual-stage index architecture that achieves both space efficiency and high performance. Our second contribution is Dual-Stage Transformation (DST), a set of guidelines for converting any order-preserving index structure into a hybrid index. Our third contribution is applying DST to four popular order-preserving index structures and evaluating th! em in bot h standalone microbenchmarks and a full in-memory DBMS using several transaction processing workloads. Our results show that hybrid indexes provide comparable throughput to the original ones while reducing the memory overhead by up to 70%.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nHuanchen Zhang is a third year PhD student advised by Professor Dave Andersen in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University.

Mutations in TF binding sites can lead to dysregulated gene expression and contribute to disease. Importantly, even small changes in gene expression can lead to disease over time, and even a small increase or decrease in TF-DNA binding affinity can have important phenotypic consequences. Thus, sensitive quantitative approaches are needed to measure and model binding of TFs to the genome, and to understand how changes in TF binding lead to changes in gene expression levels.\n\n\nAs a first step toward a quantitative understanding of transcriptional regulation, we recently developed highly accurate regression models of TF-DNA binding, trained on in vitro data generated in my laboratory. The models use features derived from the DNA sequence and structure of potential binding sites, and they have numerous advantages over current motif models. Importantly, what allows us to train very accurate and quantitative models is the fact that we use a combination of state-of-art machine learning algorithms (e.g. \u03b5-SVR with feature selection based on a modified version of LASSO) and experimental assays carefully designed to alleviate bias and minimize noise (e.g. genomic-context protein binding microarrays).\n\n\nIn two recent studies, our protein-DNA binding data and models led to new insights into the genomic recruitment of human TFs. We found that oncogenic transcription factors from the E2F family, currently believed to bind indirectly to >80% of their genomic target sites, can bind a wide variety of DNA sites in vitro. We used support vector regression models to capture the complex intrinsic binding specificity of E2Fs, and we found that it completely explains their in vivo genomic occupancy. In another study, focused on paralogous TFs with indistinguishable DNA motifs but different in vivo targets and regulatory roles, we found that such TFs interact differently with their genomic targets even in vitro. Using weighted regression models that incorporate information on the variance observed in replicate experiments, we show that differences in intrinsic specificity between paralogous TFs are a major determinant of their differential in vivo binding.\n\n\nI will also discuss current and future efforts to quantify the influences of various cellular factors (such as protein competitors and cofactors, epigenetic modifications, etc.) on the genomic recruitment and the regulatory activity of human TFs.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nRaluca Gordan is an assistant professor in the Center for Genomic & Computational Biology and the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Duke University.

Today, sensor measurements are primarily used in limited settings with coarse-grain accuracy. As device localization continues to improve, the goal of this thesis is to investigate developments towards fine-grain sensor data with centimeter-level accuracy. In particular, we show that fine-grain sensor maps enable novel data-driven algorithms that leverage awareness of surrounding conditions.\u00a0 This thesis seeks to addresses the key aspects of collecting, analyzing, and using fine-grain sensor measurements. \n\n\nMobile platforms have a distinct advantage over existing data collection efforts due\u00a0 to\u00a0 recent\u00a0 developments\u00a0 in\u00a0 localization\u00a0 and\u00a0 navigation \u00a0that\u00a0 allow\u00a0 a\u00a0 device\u00a0 to capture labeled sensor data.\u00a0 Benefits include lower costs due to reduced dedicated sensor hardware requirements, reduced human effort due to automatic localization, and increased measurement diversity from moving around.

Videos of robots are often naturally used to aid in understanding robot performance; plain videos contain no information about the processing or behavior of the robots, but such videos can be combined with extra information to improve their usefulness. The topic of my thesis is combining real systems of mobile robots with tools for understanding algorithms, so that the behavior of complex autonomous agents can be made more understandable.

While its runtime will depend on choosing a good heuristic suitable to the domain's structure, we can under mild conditions guarantee that each state is expanded at most once, and that a solution will be found to within a configurable optimality factor. In this talk, we explore these conditions in great generality, leading to a framework that encapsulates a family of known search algorithms. Some of these algorithms provide additional benefits, such as anytime solution bound improvement, dynamic path repair, multi-core processing, and the use of multiple inadmissible heuristics. Using this framework, we can better understand existing algorithms, mix and match their features in a modular fashion, and design new variants with the same theoretical guarantees.

Understanding, characterizing, and reducing retention errors can significantly improve NAND flash memory reliability and endurance. In this paper, we first characterize, with real 2y-nm MLC NAND flash chips, how the threshold voltage distribution of flash memory changes with different retention age\u00a0 the length of time since a flash cell was programmed. We observe from our characterization results that 1) the optimal read reference voltage of a flash cell, using which the data can be read with the lowest raw bit error rate (RBER), systematically changes with its retention age, and 2) different regions of flash memory can have different retention ages, and hence different optimal read reference voltages.\n\n\nBased on our findings, we propose two new techniques. First, Retention Optimized Reading (ROR) adaptively learns and applies the optimal read reference voltage for each flash memory block online. The key idea of ROR is to periodically learn a tight upper bound, and from there approach the optimal read reference voltage. Our evaluations show that ROR can extend flash memory lifetime by 64% and reduce average error correction latency by 10.1%, with only 768 KB storage overhead in flash memory for a 512 GB flash-based SSD. Second, Retention Failure Recovery (RFR) recovers data with uncorrectable errors offline by identifying and probabilistically correcting flash cells with retention errors. Our evaluation shows that RFR reduces RBER by 50%, which essentially doubles the error correction capability, and thus can effectively recover data from otherwise uncorrectable flash errors. \n\n\nFor more information, see our paper.\n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": ["2016", "June", "YIXIN", "LUO", "Data", "Retention", "Flash-Based", "SSDs", "Carnegie", "Mellon", "University"], "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/mon-2016-05-09-1200/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Data Retention in Flash-Based SSDs    ", "Speaker": "YIXIN LUO    ", "Time": "2016-05-09 12:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Speaking Skills    \n  \n        \nLOGAN BROOKS    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nComputer Science Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nForecasting Seasonal Epidemics of Influenza with an Ensemble of Customized Statistical Methods    \n  \n        \nFriday, May 6, 2016 - \n12:00pm to 1:00pm    \n  \n        \n3002\u00a0    \n  \n        \nNewell-Simon Hall    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nSeasonal epidemics of influenza cause significant morbidity, mortality, and economic loss; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that they are associated with over 200,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 to 49,000 deaths in the United States each year. Accurate and reliable forecasts of disease prevalence can assist the design of more effective countermeasures and improve hospital and public preparedness. Unfortunately, while the number of influenza infections over time within a given season follows a rough pattern, with one or two sharp peaks occurring between December and March, it is not well modeled by simple time series tools such as linear autoregression, and calls for a more tailored approach. I present one of the CMU Delphi group's systems for forecasting disease prevalence, an ensemble of empirical Bayes, regression, and kernel-based methods, and analyze its cross-validated performance when forecasting doctor visit data for influenza-like illness (ILI). \n\n\nJoint work with David Farrow, Sangwon Hyun, Shannon Gallagher, Roni Rosenfeld, and Ryan Tibshirani \n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": ["2016", "June", "LOGAN", "BROOKS", "Forecasting", "Seasonal", "Epidemics", "Influenza", "with", "Ensemble", "Customized", "Statistical", "Methods", "Carnegie", "Mellon", "University"], "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-05-06-1200/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Newell-Simon Hall", "Topic": "Forecasting Seasonal Epidemics of Influenza with an Ensemble of Customized Statistical Methods    ", "Speaker": "LOGAN BROOKS    ", "Time": "2016-05-06 12:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Speaking Skills    \n  \n        \nNIKA HAGHTALAB    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nComputer Science Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nOpting in for an Individually Rational Kidney Exchange    \n  \n        \nWednesday, May 4, 2016 - \n12:00pm to 1:00pm    \n  \n        \nASA Conference Room 6115\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nKidney transplant is sometimes the best treatment for people who suffer from chronic kidney disease. However, due to medical incompatibility issues, a direct kidney transplant is not always possible even for those patients that are fortunate enough to have a willing donor. This is where Kidney Exchange comes in: It enables two or more donor-patient pairs to swap donors, so that each patient receives a compatible kidney. In recent years, hospitals have enrolled patients into regional or even national kidney exchange programs.\n\n\nHowever, hospitals often only enroll their hard-to-match donor-patients pairs and withhold donor and patients that can be matched internally. While this behavior increases the number of matched patients for some hospitals, it significantly reduces the social welfare -- the total number of patients that receive a kidney transplant. Therefore, it is important to design a mechanism that incentivizes the hospitals to participate fully, while achieving a near optimal social welfare.\n\n\nIn this work, we introduce such a mechanism. By design, our mechanism allows hospitals to opt-in and enroll all their patients, or opt-out and only match their patients internally. Our mechanism finds a matching within O(\u221aOPT) of the optimal social welfare and guarantees individual rationality -- that by opting in each hospital receives as many matches as it could have achieved alone. Furthermore, our mechanism is optimal, in the sense that no individually rational mechanism achieves a better approximation factor. \n\n\nBased on joint work with Avrim Blum, Ioannis Caragiannis, Ariel Procaccia, Eviatar Procaccia, and Rohit Vaish. \n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Tags": ["2016", "June", "NIKA", "HAGHTALAB", "Opting", "for", "Individually", "Rational", "Kidney", "Exchange", "Carnegie", "Mellon", "University"], "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/wed-2016-05-04-1200/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers", "Topic": "Opting in for an Individually Rational Kidney Exchange    ", "Speaker": "NIKA HAGHTALAB    ", "Time": "2016-05-04 12:00:00-04:00"}, {"Description": "Thesis Orals    \n  \n        \nJAKUB PACHOCKI    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nComputer Science Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nGraphs and Beyond: Faster Algorithms for High Dimensional Convex Optimization     \n  \n        \nMonday, May 2, 2016 - 12:45pm    \n  \n        \nMcWilliams Classroom 4303\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nConvex optimization is one of the most robust tools for automated data analysis. It has widespread applications in fields such as machine learning, computer vision, combinatorial optimization and scientific computing.

How can we effectively model large attributed graphs of complex interactions? \n\n\nIn this dissertation we understand user behavior through modeling graphs.\u00a0 Online, users interact not just with each other in social networks, but also with the world around them -- supporting politicians, watching movies, buying clothing, searching for restaurants and finding doctors.\u00a0 These interactions often include insightful contextual information as attributes, such as the time of the interaction and ratings or reviews about the interaction.\u00a0 The breadth of interactions and contextual information being stored presents a new frontier for graph modeling. \n\n\nTo improve our modeling of user behavior, we focus on three broad challenges: (1) modeling abnormal behavior, (2) modeling normal behavior and (3) scaling machine learning.\u00a0 To more effectively model and detect abnormal behavior, we model how fraudsters work, catching previously undetected fraud on Facebook, Twitter, and Tencent Weibo and improving classification accuracy by up to 68%.\u00a0 By designing flexible and interpretable models of normal behavior, we can predict why you will like a particular movie.\u00a0 Last, we scale modeling of large hypergraphs by designing machine learning systems that scale to hundreds of gigabytes of data, billions of parameters, and are 26 times faster than previous methods.\u00a0 This dissertation provides a foundation for making graph modeling useful for many other applications as well as offers new directions for designing more powerful and flexible models. \n\n\nThesis Committee: Christos Faloutsos (Chair) Alexander J.

If a similar transition lies ahead, a good guess for its source is artificial intelligence in the form of whole brain emulations, or 'ems,' sometime in the next century. Drawing on academic consensus in many disciplines, I outline a baseline scenario set modestly far into a post-em-transition world. I consider computer architecture, energy use, cooling infrastructure, mind speeds, body sizes, security strategies, virtual reality conventions, labor market organization, management focus, job training, career paths, wage competition, identity, retirement, life cycles, reproduction, mating, conversation habits, wealth inequality, city sizes, growth rates, coalition politics, governance, law, and war.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nRobin Hanson is associate professor of economics at George Mason University, and research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University.

They will need to recognize these actions when they see them and they will need to perform these actions themselves. The lesson from the findings on mirror neurons is that the two processes of interpreting visually observed action and generating actions, should share the same underlying cognitive process. The talk will present a cognitive system that interprets human manipulation actions from perceptual information (image and depth data) and consists of perceptual modules and reasoning modules that are in interaction with each other.\n\n\nThe talk focuses on two core problems at the heart of manipulation action understanding: a) the grounding of relevant information about actions in perception (the perception - action integration problem), and b) the organization of perceptual and high-level symbolic information for interpreting the actions (the sequencing problem). At the high level, actions are represented with the Manipulation Action Context-free Grammar (MACFG), a syntactic grammar and associated parsing algorithms, which organizes actions as a sequence of sub-events. Each sub-event is described by the hand (as well as grasp type), movements (actions) and the objects and tools involved, and the relevant information about these quantities is obtained from biologically inspired perception modules. These modules recognize the hand grasp, manipulation action consequences and object-wise spatial primitives. Furthermore, a probabilistic semantic parsing framework based on CCG (Combinatory Categorial Grammar) theory is adopted to model the semantic meaning of human manipulation actions.\n\n\nAnalogically, understanding manipulation actions is like understanding language, while executing them is like generating language. Experiments on two tasks, 1) a robot observing people performing manipulation actions, and 2) a robot then executing manipulation actions accordingly, are conducted to validate the formalism.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nDr. Yezhou Yang is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Computer Vision Lab and the Automation, Robotics and Cognition (ARC) Lab, with the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, working with his PhD advisors: Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos and Dr. Cornelia Fermuller.
