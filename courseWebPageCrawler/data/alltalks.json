Extracting knowledge from Big Data to guide novel biological discovery is critical to fully realize its potential. However, high-dimensional genomic data is known for its heterogeneity and noise.  One important way to enrich for true signal is to examine its effects in different but complementary data types (e.g., mRNA expression, histone modification, and metabolite abundance). In this talk, I will present my work on integrating multiple types of data to study how cellular metabolic, transcriptional and epigenetic states interact in stem cell biology. First I will present a computational method that integrates gene expression, metabolite abundance and flux, and network topology to infer genome-scale cell type-specific metabolic networks. Then I will present a case study where the integration of gene expression and metabolite abundance data leads to the discovery of a metabolic enzyme controlling the level of repressive histone modifications, which in turn regulate a set of genes critical for early human development. I will also present a new approach to identify genes that regulate lineage-specific differentiation by integrating gene expression and histone modification ChIP-seq data. In the future, leveraging large genomic datasets from the ENCODE project, NIH Roadmap Epigenomics project and the FANTOM5 project, cell type-specific metabolic networks will be reconstructed as a framework to understand how developmental transcription factors affect metabolism, the pattern of epigenetic modifications in the metabolic network, and critical nodes in the metabolic network that affect epigenetic status. \n  \nBio: \nYuliang Wang is a Senior Research Associate in the Computational Biology Program, School of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University.

Today, the computing industry as a whole is facing several challenges on all the key frontiers of microprocessor innovation and development. Generational improvements in processor performance, continual reductions in its power consumption, and sustained hardware execution reliability have all but reached a plateau, if not begun to falter, due to technology scaling issues. These challenges affect all domains of computing, ranging from mobile devices to high-performance systems. This talk focuses specifically on end-user mobile computing devices, outlining the challenges that face us in building future high-performance mobile devices that are responsive on a mobile power budget. By examining the mobile application software stack and the existing processor architectures that support it, the talk presents how to bridge the increasing gap between end-user satisfaction and energy-efficient mobile computing. Domain-specific architectures, coupled with feedback-directed runtime software optimization that is guided by programmer-driven annotations, can enable us to build future high-performance, energy-efficient mobile computing devices.

It will be taped only for internal use.\n  \nWe introduce a new kernel-based approach for the design of multi-layer convolutional feature representations for signals and images. The majority of deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) require supervision to learn state-of-the-art feature representations, which can be problematic for real-world applications where supervision can be expensive or unconceivable. Unsupervised learning of feature representations is currently a major open problem. \n  \nThe proposed approach allow to define a feature representation that is based on a kernel (feature) map. The exact version of this feature representation is data-independent. An explicit kernel (feature) map can be computed to approximate it for computational efficiency, without the need for supervision. We illustrate the potential of the approach on several applications: i) patch matching; ii) image retrieval; iii) image classification.

Many objects require several hours of printing time or even have to print overnight. One could argue that the way 3D printers are currently operated is similar to the batch processing of punched cards in the early days of computing: all input parameters are pre-defined in the 3D modeling stage, the 3D printer then simply executes the instructions without human intervention. Since batch processing requires carefully thinking ahead, it is limited to expert users who can reason about the consequences of their design decisions.\n\nIn the history of computing, moving away from batch processing enabled completely new interaction paradigms: while batch processing required carefully thinking ahead, command line input allowed for tighter feedback loops, and direct manipulation finally enabled even novice users to quickly iterate towards a solution. I believe repeating this evolution for the editing of physical matter will enable novice users to build objects only trained experts can create today.\n\nIn this talk, I show how technological advances in two areas lay the foundation for achieving this goal: First, we need to develop tools that allow novice users to directly manipulate physical matter under computer control. Second, since direct manipulation requires feedback in real-time after every editing step, we need faster fabrication techniques that can accomplish instant physical change.\n\nBio\nStefanie Mueller is a PhD student working with Patrick Baudisch in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at Hasso Plattner Institute.

First, I will introduce a framework for building probabilistic models compositionally out of common modeling motifs, such as clustering, sparsity, and dimensionality reduction. This compositional framework yields a variety of existing models as special cases. We can flexibly perform posterior inference across this large, open-ended space of models by composing sophisticated inference algorithms carefully designed for the individual modeling motifs. An automatic structure search procedure over this space of models yields sensible analyses of datasets as diverse as motion capture, natural image patches, and Senate voting records, all using a single software package with no hand-tuned metaparameters. Applying a similar compositional structure search procedure to Gaussian Process models yields interpretable decompositions of diverse time series datasets and enables automatic generation of natural language reports.

To try to move beyond the cycle of attacks and patches we see today, I design and build systems with formal end-to-end guarantees.  For example, to provide strong guarantees for outsourced computations, I developed a new cryptographic framework, verifiable computation, which allows clients to outsource general computations to completely untrusted services and efficiently verify the correctness of each returned result.  Through improvements to the theory and the underlying systems, we reduced the costs of verification by over twenty orders of magnitude.  As a result, verifiable computation is now a thriving research area that has produced several startups, as well as enhancements to the security and privacy of X.509, MapReduce, and Bitcoin.\n\nWhile verifiable computation provides strong guarantees, even the best cryptographic system is useless if implemented badly, applied incorrectly, or used in a vulnerable system.  Thus, I have led a team of researchers and engineers in the Ironclad project, working to expand formal software verification to provide end-to-end guarantees about the security and reliability of complex systems.  By creating a set of new tools and methodologies, Ironclad produced the first complete stack of verified-secure software.

However, analyzing the performance of these algorithms can be challenging, as they often introduce race conditions and synchronization problems.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce a general methodology for analyzing asynchronous parallel algorithms. The key idea is to model the effects of core asynchrony as noise in the algorithmic input.

The resulting hardware demonstrations on a fixed-wing airplane constitute one of the first examples of provably safe and robust control for robotic systems with complex nonlinear dynamics that need to plan in realtime in environments with complex geometric constraints.\n  \nBio: \nAnirudha Majumdar is a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at MIT.

In view of the growing number and diversity of new devices, it becomes increasingly difficult to design for the many possible input/output characteristics and contexts of use, and interfaces remain fairly limited in their ability to adapt to devices and their role in a user's larger task. In this talk, I will describe how my research in human-computer interaction blurs the boundaries of interactive technologies and enables user interfaces to seamlessly grow, with the help of users and crowds, to take advantage of many devices and use contexts that are poorly supported by current design. For example, W3Touch allows user interfaces to adapt to a large variety of touch devices based on user performance metrics and crowd data mining; XDBrowser customizes existing single-device web interfaces for multi-device use based on user-defined cross-device design patterns; and WearWrite allows a user to provide input and interact with a document using their smartwatch on one end of the interface, and a crowd of writers to perform actions on the user's behalf using larger and more powerful devices on the other end of the interface.

This is due to the combined effect of breakdowns in transistor scaling, causing severe chip-level power limitations, and monolithic and inefficient general purpose microarchitecture.\n  \nIn this work, I propose and evaluate a concept called \"behavioral specialization\", where the design of general purpose processors is modularized by adding programmable offload engines, each best-suited for different program behaviors or characteristics.  To explore this principle, I designed a modular general-purpose core which transparently improves performance and energy efficiency by integer factors. I also extend these principles to create an architecture for highly-regular and parallelizable workloads for a further order of magnitude improvements.\n  \nI have discovered that a small number of exploitable program behaviors can cover a majority of applications, that dataflow architectures become practical and useful in hybrid execution with a general purpose core, and that programmable architectures can be competitive with domain specific alternatives on well-behaved workloads, with only small area and negligible energy overheads.  Overall, behavioral specialization causes disruptive change in microprocessor tradeoffs, enabling mobile-class processor energy-efficiency with desktop-class performance.\n  \nBio: \nTony Nowatzki is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by Karu Sankaralingam.

People strategize during these interactions, so algorithms deployed in these settings must be robust against strategic manipulation. Additionally, people prefer transparent interactions, so these algorithms must also be as simple as possible. My research addresses these, and other novel challenges that arise when algorithms interact with strategic agents.\n  \nIn this talk, I will focus on robustness against strategic manipulation, and present a new algorithmic framework for these settings. Specifically, I will present a black-box reduction from solving any optimization problem in strategic settings, where the input is held by selfish agents with interests of their own, to solving a perturbed version of that same optimization problem in traditional settings, where the input is directly given. I will further apply this framework to resolve two longstanding open problems: extending Myerson's celebrated characterization of optimal single-item auctions to multiple items (Myerson 1981), and designing truthful mechanisms for job scheduling on unrelated machines (Nisan and Ronen 1999). \n  \nFinally, I will briefly show how strategic considerations motivate nice questions in \"traditional\" areas of algorithm design as well, and present some of my work in convex optimization, parallel algorithms, and prophet inequalities. \n  \nBio: \nMatt received his PhD in EECS from MIT in 2014, where he was advised by Costis Daskalakis.

Transition-based models use a transition system, or abstract state machine, to model structured prediction problems, for example syntactic dependency parsing, as a sequence of actions. We propose a technique for learning representations of these states. Our primary innovation is a new control structure for sequence-to-sequence neural networks: the stack LSTM. Like the conventional stack data structures used in transition-based parsing, elements can be pushed to or popped from the top of the stack in constant time, but, in addition, an LSTM maintains a continuous space embedding of the stack contents. This lets us formulate efficient transition-based natural language processing models that captures three facets of the state: (i) unbounded look-ahead into the buffer of incoming words, (ii) the complete history of transition actions taken, and (iii) the complete contents of the stack of partially built fragments, including their internal structures.\n\n\nWe also discuss different approaches to word representations, by modeling words and by modeling characters. The latter improves the way of handling out of vocabulary words without using external resources and improves the performance in morphologically rich languages. Transition-based modeling for natural language processing is not limited to syntactic parsing. In this talk I will explain how we successfully applied Stack-LSTMs to dependency parsing, phrase-structure parsing, language modeling and named entity recognition with outstanding results.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nMiguel Ballesteros is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Pompeu Fabra University, in Barcelona (Spain).

Under the context of a smart cities initiative proposed by the White House, in this talk, I will focus on CPS related to large-scale cross-domain urban systems, e.g., taxi, bus, subway, cellphone and smart payment systems.\n\n\nI will first show how cross-domain data from these systems can be collaboratively utilized to capture urban mobility in real time by a new technique called multi-view bounding, which addresses overfitting issues of existing mobility models driven by single-domain data. Then I will show how the captured real-time mobility can be used to design a practical service, i.e., mobility-driven ridesharing, to provide positive feedback to urban systems themselves, e.g., reducing energy consumption and traffic congestion. Finally, I will present real-world impact of my research and some future work about CPS for smart cities.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nDesheng Zhang is a Research Associate at Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the University of Minnesota.

However, unlike linear and quadratic program- ming, general convex solvers have not yet reached sufficient maturity to fully decouple the convex programming model from the numerical algorithms required for implementation. Especially as datasets grow in size, there is a significant gap in speed and scalability between general solvers and specialized algorithms\n\n\nThis thesis addresses this gap with a new model for convex programming based on an intermediate representation of convex problems as a sum of functions with ef- ficient proximal operators. This representation serves two purposes: 1) many problems can be expressed in terms of functions with simple proximal operators, and 2) the proximal operator form serves as a general interface to any specialized algorithm that can incorporate additional l2-regularization. On a single CPU core, numerical results demonstrate that the prox-affine form results in significantly faster algorithms than existing general solvers based on conic forms. In addition, splitting problems into separable sums is attractive from the perspective of distributing solver work amongst multiple cores and machines.\n\n\nWe apply large-scale convex programming to several problems arising from building the next-generation, information-enabled electrical grid. In these problems (as is common in many domains) large, high-dimensional datasets present opportunities for novel data-driven solutions. We present approaches based on convex models for several problems: probabilistic forecasting of electricity generation and demand, preventing failures in microgrids and source separation for whole-home energy disaggregation.\n\n\nThesis Committee:J.

In this thesis, I argue that this this low security sensitivity can partially be explained by the fact that traditional security and privacy behaviors can have myriad social consequences. For example, by using two-factor authentication, one might also be perceived as \u201cparanoid\u201d or as someone with something to hide. Yet, to date, little theoretical work in usable privacy and security has applied social science theory to understand how these potential social consequences affect people\u2019s security sensitivity. Likewise, little systems work in usable privacy and security has considered the social consequences of security tool designhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/, nor have many security tools been developed with social principles in mind.\n\n\nTo bridge this gap in the literature, I will begin to build a theory of social cybersecurity and apply these theoretical insights to create interventions and security tools that improve people\u2019s security sensitivity. Specifically, through a series of observational studies, I will construct both qualitative and quantitative models of behavior to explore how and why social factors influence security sensitivity and, in turn, the diffusion of security tool adoptions through a social network. I will then conduct a series of random experiments to test if these these observational insights can be leveraged to enhance security sensitivity. I will then distill these observational and experimental results into a set of concrete design guidelines and recommendations for the effective use of social influence to increase security sensitiviy and to improve security and privacy tools. Finally, to begin exploring the design space of social cybersecurity systems, I will design, implement, and evaluate a socially compatible security system, Thumprint. In a field deployment, I will use Thumprint as a design probe to better understand how the introduction of a \u201csocial\u201d cybersecurity system affects security practices and social dynamics.\n\n\nConcretely, this thesis will provide the following contributions: (i) an initial theory of social cybersecurity, developed from both observational and experimental work, that explains how social factors affect people\u2019s security sensitivity\u2014i.e., their awareness of, motivation to use, and knowledge of how to use security tools; (ii) a set of design recommendations for creating better, more socially compatible security and privacy systems; and, (iii) the design, implementation and evaluation of a system that leverages these design recommendations to explore the design space of social cybersecurity systems.\n\n\nThesis Committee: Jason Hong (Chair) Laura Dabbish (Co-chair)Jeffrey Bigham J.D.

Yet humans have vastly slower \u2018hardware\u2019 (e.g. muscles) and \u2018wetware\u2019 (e.g. neurons). How can this paradox be resolved? Slow actuators and long communication delays require predictive control based on some form of internal model\u2014but what form? I will argue that a plausible answer is based on dynamic primitives; they enable highly dynamic behavior with minimal high-level supervision and intervention. Controlling physical interaction requires mechanical impedance to be among the classes of dynamic primitives. I will review how pre-computing appropriate mechanical impedance may be cast as an optimization problem, provided the objective function includes both force and motion at an interaction port. To combine both motion and interaction primitives, I propose a nonlinear generalization of the classical equivalent circuit. It reconciles contrasting constraints of information-processing (computation) and energy-processing (physical dynamics). I suggest that nonlinear equivalent networks provide a general basis for the internal models required for high-performance interactive control.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nNeville Hogan is Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Director of the Newman Laboratory for Biomechanics and Human Rehabilitation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Supply chains decrease development risk, but typically at the cost of increased security risk. In particular, it is often difficult to trust or verify that a component contains no unwanted behaviors, vulnerabilities, or malicious code that may harm an application or its users.\n\n\nSandboxes provide relief by encapsulating a component and imposing a security policy on it. Instead of trusting or verifying the component, we must trust or verify the relatively simple sandbox. Given this appealing prospect, researchers have spent decades developing new sandboxes. However, sandboxes are rarely used in practice. What is hampering adoption? This thesis advances our understanding of and overcomes some barriers to adoption.\n\n\nWe begin by systematically analyzing a decade of sandboxing research from relevant top-tier conferences. This work uncovers our first two challenges: sandbox researchers often (1) use relatively subjective validation techniques and (2) ignore usability.\n\n\nWe then focus on the Java sandbox to empirically study its use within the open source community. We find unnecessary complexity in the sandbox that has promoted a thriving exploit landscape. We develop run time monitors for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that disable these complexity points, stopping sandbox escaping exploits without breaking compatibility with benign applications. However, we found no cases where the sandbox was successfully used for security purposes, which motivated us to overcome necessary complexity via tooling. Our tools help users derive and refine a security policy and impose it on targeted Java application components.\n\n\nFinally, we observe vulnerability-inducing design and implementation complexity in adopted sandboxes, and thus develop and evaluate a sandboxing technique that leverages cloud computing environments to execute untrusted computations. Any malicious outcomes produced by the computations are contained by ephemeral virtual machines.\n\n\nWe evaluate our tools and sandbox in a series of case studies that investigate hard-to-sandbox cases in collaboration with industrial partners.\n\n\nThesis Committee:Jonathan Aldrich (Co-chair) William L.

Data-independent memory-hard functions are defined by fixing a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\u00a0G on n nodes which represents the dependence between the inputs and outputs of n\u00a0 calls to an underlying compression function H. Ideally we would like that to compute an iMHF (even allowing parallel calls to\u00a0H) the cumulative computational resources required should be\u00a0Omega(n^2). That is either the sum of the amount of memory used at each time step should be at least\u00a0Omega(n^2) or the total number of queries to\u00a0H should be at least Omega(n^2). In this work we demonstrate attacks on iMHFs based on three classes of DAGs each using o(n^2) resources. In particular we get that:\n\n\n(1) The Catena-Dragonfly iMHF can be computed by an algorithm with cumulative complexity O(n^{1.67}). Similarly, the cumulative complexity of the newer Catena-Butterfly iMHF is O(n^{1.67}).\n\n\n(2) The Argon2i iMHF (winner of the Password Hashing Competition) can be computed by an algorithm with cumulative complexity O(n^{7/4}\\log(n)).\n\n\n(3) Any iMHF can be computed by an algorithm with cumulative complexity O(n^2/\\log^{1-\\epsilon}(n)) for all epsilon > 0.\n\n\nAt a technical level we provide a general attack against any iMHF defined by a DAG $G=(V,E)$ that is not depth-robust, meaning that we can find a ``small' set $S\\subset V$ of nodes such that $G-S$ does not contain a ``long' path. \u00a0We demonstrate that the Catena and Argon2i DAGs are not depth robust in an extreme sense. Furthermore, no simple DAG (constant indegree) is sufficiently depth robust to resist an attack with cumulative complexity\u00a0 O(n^2/\\log^{1-\\epsilon}(n)). This shows that the goal of constructing an iMHF requiring Omega(n^2) cumulative resources is unachievable.\n\n\nJoint work with Joel Alwen (IST Austria)\n\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\n\n\u00a0\n    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\nnlc [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-03-25 10:30:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-03-25-1030/computer-science-distinguished-lecture", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "'What the 0x5f3759df?!'
