Extracting knowledge from Big Data to guide novel biological discovery is critical to fully realize its potential. However, high-dimensional genomic data is known for its heterogeneity and noise.  One important way to enrich for true signal is to examine its effects in different but complementary data types (e.g., mRNA expression, histone modification, and metabolite abundance). In this talk, I will present my work on integrating multiple types of data to study how cellular metabolic, transcriptional and epigenetic states interact in stem cell biology. First I will present a computational method that integrates gene expression, metabolite abundance and flux, and network topology to infer genome-scale cell type-specific metabolic networks. Then I will present a case study where the integration of gene expression and metabolite abundance data leads to the discovery of a metabolic enzyme controlling the level of repressive histone modifications, which in turn regulate a set of genes critical for early human development. I will also present a new approach to identify genes that regulate lineage-specific differentiation by integrating gene expression and histone modification ChIP-seq data. In the future, leveraging large genomic datasets from the ENCODE project, NIH Roadmap Epigenomics project and the FANTOM5 project, cell type-specific metabolic networks will be reconstructed as a framework to understand how developmental transcription factors affect metabolism, the pattern of epigenetic modifications in the metabolic network, and critical nodes in the metabolic network that affect epigenetic status. \n  \nBio: \nYuliang Wang is a Senior Research Associate in the Computational Biology Program, School of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University.

Today, the computing industry as a whole is facing several challenges on all the key frontiers of microprocessor innovation and development. Generational improvements in processor performance, continual reductions in its power consumption, and sustained hardware execution reliability have all but reached a plateau, if not begun to falter, due to technology scaling issues. These challenges affect all domains of computing, ranging from mobile devices to high-performance systems. This talk focuses specifically on end-user mobile computing devices, outlining the challenges that face us in building future high-performance mobile devices that are responsive on a mobile power budget. By examining the mobile application software stack and the existing processor architectures that support it, the talk presents how to bridge the increasing gap between end-user satisfaction and energy-efficient mobile computing. Domain-specific architectures, coupled with feedback-directed runtime software optimization that is guided by programmer-driven annotations, can enable us to build future high-performance, energy-efficient mobile computing devices. Synergistic, and systematic, cross-layer optimization is a fundamental necessity for overcoming the performance, power and reliability challenges that mark the \"end\" of the Moore's Law era and the beginning of the Moore's crawl period.\n  \nBiography: \nVijay Janapa Reddi is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin.

It will be taped only for internal use.\n  \nWe introduce a new kernel-based approach for the design of multi-layer convolutional feature representations for signals and images. The majority of deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) require supervision to learn state-of-the-art feature representations, which can be problematic for real-world applications where supervision can be expensive or unconceivable. Unsupervised learning of feature representations is currently a major open problem. \n  \nThe proposed approach allow to define a feature representation that is based on a kernel (feature) map. The exact version of this feature representation is data-independent. An explicit kernel (feature) map can be computed to approximate it for computational efficiency, without the need for supervision. We illustrate the potential of the approach on several applications: i) patch matching; ii) image retrieval; iii) image classification. We settle new state-of-the-art, or compete on par with state-of-the-art methods, on public benchmarks for all three computer vision tasks. \n  \nBio: \nZaid Harchaoui is currently Visiting Assistant Professor at the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences of NYU.

Many objects require several hours of printing time or even have to print overnight. One could argue that the way 3D printers are currently operated is similar to the batch processing of punched cards in the early days of computing: all input parameters are pre-defined in the 3D modeling stage, the 3D printer then simply executes the instructions without human intervention. Since batch processing requires carefully thinking ahead, it is limited to expert users who can reason about the consequences of their design decisions.\n\nIn the history of computing, moving away from batch processing enabled completely new interaction paradigms: while batch processing required carefully thinking ahead, command line input allowed for tighter feedback loops, and direct manipulation finally enabled even novice users to quickly iterate towards a solution. I believe repeating this evolution for the editing of physical matter will enable novice users to build objects only trained experts can create today.\n\nIn this talk, I show how technological advances in two areas lay the foundation for achieving this goal: First, we need to develop tools that allow novice users to directly manipulate physical matter under computer control. Second, since direct manipulation requires feedback in real-time after every editing step, we need faster fabrication techniques that can accomplish instant physical change.\n\nBio\nStefanie Mueller is a PhD student working with Patrick Baudisch in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at Hasso Plattner Institute.

First, I will introduce a framework for building probabilistic models compositionally out of common modeling motifs, such as clustering, sparsity, and dimensionality reduction. This compositional framework yields a variety of existing models as special cases. We can flexibly perform posterior inference across this large, open-ended space of models by composing sophisticated inference algorithms carefully designed for the individual modeling motifs. An automatic structure search procedure over this space of models yields sensible analyses of datasets as diverse as motion capture, natural image patches, and Senate voting records, all using a single software package with no hand-tuned metaparameters. Applying a similar compositional structure search procedure to Gaussian Process models yields interpretable decompositions of diverse time series datasets and enables automatic generation of natural language reports.  Finally, compositional structure search depends crucially on the estimation of intractable likelihoods.

It will not be available for on-demand viewing.\n  \nFrequent headline-grabbing data breaches suggest that current best practices for safeguarding personal data are woefully inadequate.  To try to move beyond the cycle of attacks and patches we see today, I design and build systems with formal end-to-end guarantees.  For example, to provide strong guarantees for outsourced computations, I developed a new cryptographic framework, verifiable computation, which allows clients to outsource general computations to completely untrusted services and efficiently verify the correctness of each returned result.  Through improvements to the theory and the underlying systems, we reduced the costs of verification by over twenty orders of magnitude.  As a result, verifiable computation is now a thriving research area that has produced several startups, as well as enhancements to the security and privacy of X.509, MapReduce, and Bitcoin.\n\nWhile verifiable computation provides strong guarantees, even the best cryptographic system is useless if implemented badly, applied incorrectly, or used in a vulnerable system.  Thus, I have led a team of researchers and engineers in the Ironclad project, working to expand formal software verification to provide end-to-end guarantees about the security and reliability of complex systems.  By creating a set of new tools and methodologies, Ironclad produced the first complete stack of verified-secure software.  We also recently developed the first methodology for verifying both the safety and liveness of complex distributed systems implementations.  While interesting challenges remain, I expect that verification will fundamentally improve the software that underpins our digital and physical infrastructure.\n\nBio\nBryan Parno is a Researcher in the Security and Privacy Group at Microsoft Research.

It will be taped only for internal UW CSE faculty use.\n\nFuture visual computing applications -- from photorealistic real-time rendering, to 4D light field cameras, to pervasive sensing and computer vision-demand orders of magnitude more computation than we currently have. From data centers to mobile devices, performance and energy scaling is limited by locality (the distance over which data has to move, e.g., from nearby caches, far away main memory, or across networks) and parallelism. Because of this, I argue that we should think of the performance and efficiency of an application as determined not just by the algorithm and the hardware on which it runs, but critically also by the organization of computations and data. For algorithms with the same complexity -- even the exact same set of arithmetic operations and data executing on the same hardware, the order and granularity of execution and placement of data can easily change performance by an order of magnitude because of locality and parallelism. To extract the full potential of our machines, we must treat the organization of computation as a first class concern while working across all levels from algorithms and data structures, to compilers, to hardware.\n\nThis talk will present facets of this philosophy in systems I have built for visual computing applications from image processing and vision, to 3D rendering, simulation, optimization, and 3D printing. I will show that, for data-parallel pipelines common in graphics, imaging, and other data-intensive applications, the organization of computations and data for a given algorithm is constrained by a fundamental tension between parallelism, locality, and redundant computation of shared values. I will focus particularly on the Halide language and compiler for image processing, which explicitly separates what computations define an algorithm from the choices of organization which determine parallelism, locality, memory footprint, and synchronization. I will show how this approach can enable much simpler programs to deliver performance often many times faster than the best prior hand-tuned C, assembly, and CUDA implementations, while scaling across radically different architectures, from ARM cores, to massively parallel GPUs, to FPGAs and custom ASICs.\n\nBio\n\nJonathan Ragan-Kelley is a postdoc in computer science at Stanford.

In this talk, I will discuss strategies to gracefully scale machine learning on modern parallel computational platforms. A common approach to such scaling is coordination-free parallel algorithms, where individual processors run independently without communication, thus maximizing the time they compute. However, analyzing the performance of these algorithms can be challenging, as they often introduce race conditions and synchronization problems.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce a general methodology for analyzing asynchronous parallel algorithms. The key idea is to model the effects of core asynchrony as noise in the algorithmic input.  This allows us to understand the performance of several popular asynchronous machine learning approaches, and to determine when asynchrony effects might overwhelm them.  To overcome these effects, I will propose a new framework for parallelizing ML algorithms, where all memory conflicts and race conditions can be completely avoided. I will discuss the implementation of these ideas in practice, and demonstrate that they outperform the state-of-the-art across a large number of ML tasks on gigabyte-scale data sets.\n\nBio\nDimitris Papailiopoulos is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley and a member of the AMPLab.

Envisioned by Diffie and Hellman already in the 70's as a means of obtaining public-key encryption, it is known by now that this concept may have far reaching implications to cryptography and complexity theory. In particular, program obfuscation suggests (often exclusive) solutions to some of the most challenging privacy and security problems in the age of cloud computing and social networks.\n\nAt the same time, program obfuscation has turned out to be  an evasive goal to achieve, or to even meaningfully define. For a long time, solutions have been confined to heuristics, whereas attempts to achieve any sense of provable security have mostly led to impossibility results. This gloomy state dramatically changed in recent years, when it was shown that a relatively weak notion called indistinguishability obfuscation may be within reach (so far, based on strong computational assumptions) and still has the potential of realizing many dream applications.\n\nIn this talk, I will review the different aspects of obfuscation, including central notions, limitations, and feasibility. As a demonstration of the power of obfuscation, I will present a recent implication [Bitansky-Paneth-Rosen, FOCS15] that goes beyond cryptography into a fundamental problem in complexity and algorithmic game theory -- the hardness of finding a Nash equilibrium.

The algorithm is very practical and achieves good experimental performance for both natural and artificial problems. The lynchpin of this algorithm is a new hypothesis class called smooth lists of halfspaces. They are more flexible than halfspaces, but do not require more data to train in the worst case.

This can be useful when looking for hidden parsimonious structures in data, each involving only a small subset of all features. The discovered correlations are highly interpretable as they are formed by pairs of sparse linear combinations of the original features. In addition,\u00a0this results in useful visualizations of data.\n\n\nIn this paper\u00a0it is shown how CAA can be of use as a tool for anomaly detection when an expected structure of correlations is not followed by anomalous data. In the case of radiation threat detection, this allows characterization of harmless radiation data based on the patterns across bins of photon counts, and flagging of anomalies where they fail to follow such patterns. The resulting technique performs significantly better than an unsupervised alternative prevalent in the domain, while providing valuable additional insights for threat analysis.\n\n\nDAP Committee: Artur Dubrawski (Advisor) Daniel NagiSimon Labov (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)\n\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nDAP    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-20 12:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/wed-2016-04-20-1200/joint-machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-heinz-first-paper", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Hamburg Hall"}, {"Topic": "MIT Sloan School of Management    ", "Speaker": "CATHERINE TUCKER    ", "Description": "Seminars    \n  \n        \nCATHERINE TUCKER    \n  \n        \nSloan Distinguished Professor of Management Science     \n  \n        \nand Professor of Marketing,     \n  \n        \nMIT Sloan School of Management    \n  \n        \nPrivacy Protection, Personalized Medicine and Genetic Testing    \n  \n        \nMonday, April 11, 2016 - \n12:00pm to 1:30pm    \n  \n        \n1502\u00a0    \n  \n        \nHamburg Hall    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nThis paper explores how state genetic privacy laws affect the diffusion of personalized medicine, using data on genetic testing for cancer risks. State genetic privacy laws take three alternative approaches to protecting patient privacy: Requiring informed consent on the part of the individual; restricting discriminatory usage of genetic data by employers, health care providers or insurance companies; or limiting redisclosure without the consent of the individual or defining genetic data as the 'property' of the individual. We find empirically that approaches to genetic and health privacy that give users control over redisclosure encourage the spread of genetic testing, but that the informed consent approach deters individuals from obtaining genetic tests. We present some evidence that the latter reflects costs imposed on the supply of genetic testing by hospitals. We find no effects of state or federal genetic anti-discrimination laws on genetic testing rates.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nCatherine Tucker is the Sloan Distinguished Professor of Management Science and Professor of Marketing at MIT Sloan.

To help close this gap, we recently created GenderMag, a systematic inspection method to enable software practitioners to evaluate their software for issues of gender-inclusiveness. In this talk, we present the first real-world investigation of software practitioners' ability to identify gender-inclusiveness issues in software they create/maintain using this method. Our investigation was a multiple-case field study of software teams at three major U.S. technology organizations. The results were that, using GenderMag to evaluate software, these software practitioners identified a surprisingly high number of gender-inclusiveness issues: 25% of the software features they evaluated had gender-inclusiveness issues. We present these results and more, along with tales from the trenches on what it\u2019s like to use GenderMag, where the pitfalls lie, and all the things we are still in the process of learning about it.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nMargaret Burnett is an OSU Distinguished Professor at Oregon State University.\u00a0 She began her career in industry, where she was the first woman software developer ever hired at Procter & Gamble Ivorydale.\u00a0 A few degrees and start-ups later, she joined academia, with a research focus on people who are engaged in some form of software development.\u00a0 She\u00a0 leads the team that created GenderMag, a software inspection process that uncovers gender inclusiveness issues in software from spreadsheets to programming environments.\u00a0 Burnett is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and a member of the ACM CHI Academy.\u00a0 She current serves on three editorial boards, on several conference committees, and on the\u00a0 Academic Alliance Advisory Board of the National Center for Women in IT (NCWIT). >\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n        \nEvent Website    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nHCII    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\njpuglisi [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-12 13:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/tue-2016-04-12-1300/special-human-computer-interaction-institute-seminar", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Supervision Beyond Manual Annotations for Learning Visual Representations    ", "Speaker": "CARL DOERSCH    ", "Description": "Thesis Orals    \n  \n        \nCARL DOERSCH    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nMachine Learning Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nSupervision Beyond Manual Annotations for Learning Visual Representations    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 15, 2016 - 1:00pm    \n  \n        \n1507\u00a0    \n  \n        \nNewell-Simon Hall    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nFor both humans and machines, understanding the visual world requires relating new percepts with past experience. We argue that a good visual representation for an image should encode what makes it similar to other images, enabling the recall of associated experiences. Current machine implementations of visual representations can capture some aspects of similarity, but fall far short of human ability overall. Even if one explicitly labels objects in millions of images to tell the computer what should be considered similar\u2014a very expensive procedure\u2014the labels still do not capture everything that might be relevant.\n\n\nThis thesis shows that one can often train a representation which captures similarity beyond what is labeled in a given dataset. That means we can begin with a dataset that has uninteresting labels, or even one without labels, and still build a useful representation. To do this, we propose to using pretext tasks: tasks that are not useful in and of themselves, but serve as an excuse to learn a more general-purpose representation. The labels for a pretext task can be inexpensive or even free. Furthermore, since this approach assumes training labels differ from the desired outputs, it can handle output spaces where the correct answer is ambiguous, and therefore impossible to annotate by hand.\n\n\nThe thesis explores two broad classes of supervision. The first is weak image-level supervision, which is exploited to train mid-level discriminative patch classifiers. For example, given a dataset of street-level imagery labeled only with GPS coordinates, patch classifiers are trained to differentiate one specific geographical region (e.g. the city of Paris) from others. The resulting classifiers each automatically collect and associate a set of patches which all depict the same distinctive architectural element. In this way, we can learn to detect elements like balconies, signs, and lamps without annotations. The second type of supervision requires no information about images other than the pixels themselves. Instead, the algorithm is trained to predict the context around image patches. The context serves as a sort of weak label: to predict well, the algorithm must associate similar-looking patches which also have similar contexts. After training, the feature representation learned using this within-image context indeed captures visual similarity across images, which ultimately makes it useful for real tasks like object detection and geometry estimation.\n\n\nThesis Committee:Alexei A.

This paradigm shift requires rethinking robot learning algorithms as all decision making processes are thus based on uncertain, incomplete observations obtained from high-dimensional sensory in-put.\n\n\nThus, data-driven action generation can no longer rely on simply reproducing good trajectories but rather has to take the un-certainty on demonstrated and experienced movements into account. Using these insights, I will present probabilistic approaches to the representation, execution and learning of movement policies. Central to these approaches is a new skill representation called probabilistic movement primitives (ProMP) that allow capturing the variability and inherent correlations essential to a better generalization of the task from few examples. With such ProMPs, difficult robot learning problems can be treated in a principled manner. For example, coupling of movements to selected perceptual input and prioritized concurrent execution of movements can be achieved using classical operators from probability theory.\n\n\nWhile the resulting probabilistic policies naturally enable learning from demonstrations, they can-not automatically address the exploration-exploitation dilemma. I will show that new class of reinforcement algorithms arises from information theoretic insights by bounding both the loss of in-formation and entropy during the policy updates in reward-related self-improvement.

We use session types, types that change as every step of the computation is performed, to prescribe the communication behavior between concurrent message-passing processes. We then use these session types to dynamically monitor the communication between processes to detect undesirable behavior. In this talk, we discuss how to dynamically monitor communication to enforce adherence to session types in a higher-order setting. We present a system of blame assignment in the case when the monitor detects an undesirable action and an alarm is raised. \n\n\nJoint work with Frank Pfenning and Limin Jia. \n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nSCSDay    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-22 12:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-22-1200/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Influenza Trend Prediction Using Kalman Filters and Particle Filters    ", "Speaker": "YING ZHANG    ", "Description": "Project Presentations    \n  \n        \nYING ZHANG    \n  \n        \nSecondary Masters Student    \n  \n        \nMachine Learning Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nInfluenza Trend Prediction Using Kalman Filters and Particle Filters    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 8, 2016 - 5:00pm    \n  \n        \n8102\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nSeasonal influenza can cause severe health problems and significant economic burdens in various regions of the world. Forecasting the influenza trends is crucial in developing effective countermeasures to mitigate an epidemic outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collected several indicators of influenza-like illness (ILI) through its surveillance network. Furthermore, the high correlation of web data of Twitter messages and Wikipedia article access with the ILI data allows the robust prediction of influenza when ILI data is delayed in the surveillance network. Filtering techniques (Kalman filters and particle filters) are known to provide better estimates of a dynamic system based on the measurements from the past to the current time through a recursive Bayesian update.\n\n\nWe implemented several filtering methods for a synthetic data set, which is generated using an epidemic propagation model with added noise. This synthetic data set allows a quantitative evaluation of log likelihood and mean square error for the filtering methods. We then examined the extended Kalman filter and particle filter in modeling the real influenza data (ILI data, Wikipedia and twitter signals). The filtering methods demonstrate fine performance in predicting peak time of infectious population in both the synthetic data and real influenza data. The peaks estimated from the filter methods are approximately one to two weeks delayed from the true occurrence time of influenza peak. This delay in estimation may be unavoidable as filter methods are mainly based on the past data.\n\n\nDAP Committee: Roni Rosenfeld, Ryan Tibshirani, Roy Maxion\n    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nMLD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-08 17:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-08-1700/machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-v", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Scene Recognition with Deep Learning    ", "Speaker": "WEI DAI    ", "Description": "Project Presentations    \n  \n        \nWEI DAI    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nMachine Learning Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nScene Recognition with Deep Learning    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 8, 2016 - 3:00pm    \n  \n        \n8102\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nSound is an important modality for perceiving the the environment, complementing visual inputs, with the benefit that sound can be more easily collected and stored.

Using the dataset from the ongoing IEEE challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) which includes 15 diverse indoor and outdoor environments, we study 5 deep learning models and 2 popular traditional acoustic models on 4 feature representations.

With the exponential growth of modern industrial scale data and the ambition to capture more refined hidden information through exploring bigger models, topic models face the significant scalability challenge which lots of previous work has been devoted to addressing, culminating in the recent fast Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms in Li et al. (2014); Yuan et al. (2015) for the unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) formulations.\n\n\nIn this work we extend the recent sampling advances for unsupervised LDA models to supervised tasks. We focus on the MedLDA model Zhu et al. (2013b) that is able to simultaneously discover latent structures and make accurate predictions. Through innovative combinations of a set of sampling techniques such as mixtures of MCMC kernels, we are able to reduce the O(K^3 + DK^2) complexity in Zhu et al. (2013b) to O(DK) when there are K topics and D documents. In our experiments with 20 newsgroups and labeled Wikipedia dataset, we show that the new algorithm is able to learn the latent structure of text data more efficiently, opening up possibilities for real-time text analytics and prediction.\n\n\nDAP Committee: Eric Xing, Roy Maxion\n    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nMLD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-08 14:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-08-1400/machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-iii", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Identifying Influential Users in Social Network with Review Data    ", "Speaker": "YILIN HE    ", "Description": "Project Presentations    \n  \n        \nYILIN HE    \n  \n        \nSecondary Masters Student    \n  \n        \nMachine Learning Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nIdentifying Influential Users in Social Network with Review Data    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 8, 2016 - 12:30pm    \n  \n        \n8102\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nSocial networks have been widely utilized by a variety of popular review websites, and different users have a different impact on how information propagates through the network.

Neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), often contain many thousands of functional observations per subject. While some success has been had using heuristical summary statistics of neuroimaging functional observations to build predictive models, there is a lack of a flexible and principled framework to build models from neuroimaging techniques.\n\n\nAim. Our aim is to develop a general, principled framework for supervised learning that scales to many thousands of neuroimaging functional observations per subject without resorting to heuristical summary statistics. In particular, we look to regress a subject\u2019s age given neuroimaging data.\n\n\nData. Diffusion MR images were acquired from a total of 90 subjects. The subjects ranged in age from 13 to 60 years old, and included 45 males and 45 females. The subjects had no known history of neurological or mental disorder. We used per-voxel functional covariates of diffusion orientation distribution functions (dODFs) in our models and real-valued fractional anisotropy (FA) covariates as a baseline. dODFs are functions that represent the amount of water molecules, or spins, undergoing diffusion indifferent orientations over the S 2 sphere. FA values are the peak of the dODF and have previously been used as a summary statistic of dODFs for age regression. In total, 25K voxels were considered in a shared template-space.\n\n\nMethods. We develop and empirically test linear functional models for neuroimaging data. We use a model that represents neuroimaging functional observations nonparametrically using orthonormal basis projections. The age response is modeled as a sparse additive linear combination of inner products. We show that our model may be optimized using a group-LASSO approach.\n\n\nResults. Our functional sparse linear model was able to predict age with a 29.15% lower MSE than previous heuristic-based methods. Results were found to be statistically significant with a p-value of 0.04 using a paired t-test. Conclusions. In this work we have developed and tested a principled framework for building predictive supervised models with functional neuroimaging data. This framework allows one to use functional neuro-data in a statistically principled fashion without resorting to heuristical summary statistics.\n\n\nDAP Committee: Barnabas Poczos, Jeff Schneider, Roy Maxion   \n    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nMLD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndiane [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-08 09:30:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-08-0930/machine-learning-data-analysis-project-presentation-i", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Learning Multimodal Deep Models    ", "Speaker": " RUSLAN SALAKHUTDINOV    ", "Description": "Colloquium    \n  \n        \n RUSLAN SALAKHUTDINOV    \n  \n        \nAssistant Professor    \n  \n        \nDepartments of Statistics and Computer Science    \n  \n        \nUniversity of Toronto    \n  \n        \nLearning Multimodal Deep Models    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 8, 2016 - \n2:30pm to 3:45pm    \n  \n        \nRashid Auditorium 4401\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nBuilding intelligent systems that are capable of extracting meaningful representations from high-dimensional data lies at the core of solving many AI related tasks, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, speech perception, and language understanding.\n\n\nIn this talk I will first introduce a broad class of deep learning models and show that they can learn useful hierarchical representations from large volumes of high-dimensional data with applications in information retrieval, object recognition, and speech perception.

The cost incurred by each point is the distance to the furthest point in its cluster, and the cost of the clustering is the sum of all these per-point-costs. This problem is motivated by questions in generating automatic abstractions of extensive-form games.\n\n\nWe reduce this problem to a local k-median problem where each facility has a prescribed radius and can only connect to clients within that radius. Our main results are a constant-factor bicriteria approximation algorithm for the local k-median problem, and hence a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the aversion k-clustering problem. We use a primal-dual approach; our technical contribution is a non-local rounding step which we feel is of broader interest.\n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-20 12:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/wed-2016-04-20-1200/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "CFA: A Practical Prediction System for Video QoE Optimization    ", "Speaker": "JUNCHEN JIANG    ", "Description": "Speaking Skills    \n  \n        \nJUNCHEN JIANG    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nComputer Science Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nCFA: A Practical Prediction System for Video QoE Optimization    \n  \n        \nMonday, April 18, 2016 - \n12:00pm to 1:00pm    \n  \n        \nTraffic21 Classroom 6501\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nMany prior efforts have suggested that Internet video Quality of Experience (QoE) could be dramatically improved by using data-driven prediction of video quality for different choices (e.g., CDN or bitrate) to make optimal decisions. However, building such a prediction system is challenging on two fronts. First, the relationships between video quality and observed session features can be quite complex. Second, video quality changes dynamically.\n\n\nThus, we need a prediction model that is (a) expressive enough to capture these complex relationships and (b) capable of updating quality predictions in near real-time. Unfortunately, several seemingly natural solutions (e.g., simple machine learning approaches and simple network models) fail on one or more fronts. Thus, the potential benefits promised by these prior efforts remain unrealized.\n\n\nWe address these challenges and present the design and implementation of Critical Feature Analytics (CFA). The design of CFA is driven by domain-specific insights that video quality is typically determined by a small subset of critical features whose criticality persists over several tens of minutes. This enables a scalable and accurate workflow where we automatically learn critical features for different sessions on coarse-grained timescales, while updating quality predictions in near real-time. Using a combination of a real-world pilot deployment and trace-driven analysis, we demonstrate that CFA leads to significant improvements in video quality; e.g., 32% less buffering time and 12% higher bitrate than a random decision maker.\n\n\nThis is a joint work with Vyas Sekar, Hui Zhang, and Ion Stoica \n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-18 12:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/mon-2016-04-18-1200/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Peloton: Street Strength Database Management System for Real-Time Analytics     ", "Speaker": "JOY ARULRAJ    ", "Description": "Speaking Skills    \n  \n        \nJOY ARULRAJ    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nComputer Science Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nPeloton: Street Strength Database Management System for Real-Time Analytics     \n  \n        \nThursday, April 14, 2016 - \n2:00pm to 3:00pm    \n  \n        \n8102\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nData-intensive applications seek to obtain new insights in real-time by analyzing a combination of historical data sets alongside recently collected data. This means that to support such hybrid workloads, database management systems (DBMSs) need to handle both fast ACID transactions and complex analytical queries on the same database. But the current trend is to use specialized systems that are optimized for only one of these workloads, and thus require an organization to maintain separate copies of the database. This adds additional cost to deploying a database application in terms of both storage and administration overhead. \n\n\nTo overcome this barrier, we present a hybrid DBMS architecture that efficiently supports varied workloads on the same database. Our approach differs from previous methods in that we use a single execution engine that is oblivious to the storage layout of data without sacrificing the performance benefits of the specialized systems. This obviates the need to maintain separate copies of the database in multiple independent systems. We also present a technique to continuously evolve the databases physical storage layout by analyzing the queries access patterns and choosing the optimal layout for different segments of data within the same table. To evaluate this work, we implemented our architecture in an in-memory DBMS. Our results show that our approach delivers up to 3 times higher throughput compared to static storage layouts across different workloads. We also demonstrate that our continuous adaptation mechanism allows the DBMS to achieve a near-optimal layout for an arbitrary workload without requiring any manual tuning.\n\n\nThis is joint work with Andy Pavlo and Prashanth Menon. \n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-14 14:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/thu-2016-04-14-1400/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Securing Passive Replication Through Verification    ", "Speaker": "BRUNO VAVALA    ", "Description": "Speaking Skills    \n  \n        \nBRUNO VAVALA    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nComputer Science Department    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nSecuring Passive Replication Through Verification    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 29, 2016 - \n12:00pm to 1:00pm    \n  \n        \nTraffic21 Classroom 6501\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nReplication is a fundamental technique to guarantee service availability and consistency.

This results in redundant service executions that are inefficient and typically force the service to be deterministic so to achieve consistency (i.e., if correct replicas process the same requests in order, they produce the same output). \n\n\nIn this seminar we introduce the concept of hardware-based computation verification in the area of fault-tolerant replication. It is shown how the technique allows to deal with malicious replicas while linearly (in the number of replicas) reducing the computational effort to execute a fault-tolerant distributed service. In particular, we design a fully passive replicated system that dramatically reduces the fault-tolerance complexity, in terms of protocols, number of messages, processing effort and allows non-deterministic operations. Also, we implement a system prototype based on commodity hardware and on recent research work in Trusted Computing (TC). Finally, we show experimentally that our system delivers good performance, compared to optimized state-of-the-art systems, despite its main overhead is due to TC technology.\n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement.\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-29 12:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2016-04-29-1200/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "A Spreadsheet Model for Using Web Services and Creating Data-Driven Applications     ", "Speaker": "KERRY CHANG    ", "Description": "Thesis Orals    \n  \n        \nKERRY CHANG    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nHuman-Computer Interaction Institute    \n  \n        \nCarnegie Mellon University    \n  \n        \nA Spreadsheet Model for Using Web Services and Creating Data-Driven Applications     \n  \n        \nTuesday, April 12, 2016 - 2:30pm    \n  \n        \nRashid Auditorium 4401\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nWeb services have made many kinds of data and computational services available. However, to use web services often requires significant programming efforts and thus limits the people who can take advantage of them to only a small group of skilled programmers. In this dissertation, I will present a tool called Gneiss that extends the spreadsheet model to support four challenging aspects of using web services: programming two-way data communications with web services, creating interactive GUI applications that use web services, using hierarchical data, and using live streaming data.\n\n\nGneiss contributes innovations in spreadsheet languages, spreadsheet user interfaces and interaction techniques to allow programming tasks that currently require writing complex, lengthy code to instead be done using familiar spreadsheet mechanisms. Spreadsheets are arguably the most successful and popular data tools among people of all programming levels. This work advances the use of spreadsheets to new domains and could benefit a wide range of users from professional programmers to end-user programmers.\n\n\nThesis Committee:Brad Myers\u00a0 (Chair)Niki Kittur John ZimmermanMargaret Burnett (Oregon State University)\n\n\nCopy of Thesis Document\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nHCII    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\nqkravitz [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-12 14:30:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/tue-2016-04-12-1430/human-computer-interaction-thesis-defense", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "THOMAS LATOZA    ", "Speaker": "TBD", "Description": "Seminars    \n  \n        \nTHOMAS LATOZA    \n  \n        \nAssistant Professor    \n  \n        \nDepartment of Computer Science    \n  \n        \nGeorge Mason University    \n  \n        \nTuesday, April 19, 2016 - \n12:00pm to 1:00pm    \n  \n        \nTraffic 21 Classroom 6501\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n        \nSeries Website    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nHCII    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\njpuglisi [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-19 12:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/tue-2016-04-19-1200/crowdsourcing-lunch-seminar", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Computer Science Division    ", "Speaker": "SAURABH GUPTA    ", "Description": "Seminars    \n  \n        \nSAURABH GUPTA    \n  \n        \nPh.D. Student    \n  \n        \nComputer Science Division    \n  \n        \nUniversity of California, Berkeley    \n  \n        \nScene Understanding from RGB-D Images    \n  \n        \nMonday, April 11, 2016 - \n3:00pm to 4:00pm    \n  \n        \n1507\u00a0    \n  \n        \nNewell-Simon Hall    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nThe focus of this talk will be on detailed scene understanding from RGB-D images. We approach this problem by studying a variety of central vision problems like bottom-up grouping, object detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation in context of RGB-D images, and finally aligning CAD models to objects in the scene. This results in a detailed output which goes beyond what most current computer vision algorithms produce: a bounding box or a segmentation mask for the object of interest; and is useful for a variety of real world applications like perceptual robotics, and augmented reality.\u00a0 A central question in this work is how to learn good features for depth images in view of the fact that labeled RGB-D datasets are much smaller than labeled RGB datasets (such as ImageNet) typically used for feature learning, and I will describe our 'cross-modal distillation' technique which allows us to leverage easily available annotations on RGB images to learn representations on depth images.

But their decision-making processes are often opaque---it is difficult to explain why a certain decision was made---thus raising concerns about inadvertent introduction of harms. We develop a formal foundation to improve the transparency of such decision-making systems that operate over large volumes of personal information about individuals.\u00a0 Specifically, we introduce a family of Quantitative Input Influence (QII) measures that capture the degree of influence of inputs on outputs of machine learning algorithms. Our causal QII measures carefully account for correlations among inputs and capture input influence on aggregate effects on groups of individuals (e.g., disparate impact based on race).\n\n\nThe QII measures also capture the joint influence of a set of inputs on outputs using an aggregation method with a strong theoretical justification.\u00a0 Apart from demonstrating general trends in a system, QII guides the construction of personalized transparency reports that provide insights into an individual's classification outcomes. Our empirical validation demonstrates that our QII measures are a useful transparency mechanism when black box access to the learning system is available; in particular, they provide better explanations than standard associative measures for a host of scenarios that we consider. Further, we show that in the situations we consider, QII is efficiently approximable and can be made differentially private with very little addition of noise. \n\n\nJoint work with Anupam Datta and Yair Zick. \n\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement. \n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nCSD    \n  \n    For More Information, Please Contact:     \n\n\n\ndeb [atsymbol] cs.cmu.edu", "Time": "2016-04-12 14:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/tue-2016-04-12-1400/computer-science-speaking-skills-talk", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "HAK Language Technologies    ", "Speaker": "HASSAN A\u00cfT-KACI    ", "Description": "Talks    \n  \n        \nHASSAN A\u00cfT-KACI    \n  \n        \nHAK Language Technologies    \n  \n        \nTowards Declarative Scripting: Combining Constraint Processing and Analytics    \n  \n        \nFriday, April 8, 2016 - 10:00am    \n  \n        \nReddy Conference Room 4405\u00a0    \n  \n        \nGates&Hillman Centers    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nThis is a high-level glance at current trends in the Analytics and Constraint Processing landscape from the perspective of declarative programming language use and design (the forest rather than the trees) as well as speculate and extrapolate some perspectives therefrom (what seems to be needed).\u00a0 This presentation makes a statement concerning the current evolution of application software programming. In particular, it is noted that a new specific area of software development is rapidly gaining in importance; namely, scripting---i.e., application modules orchestration and choreography. This has become a clear need in particular for Data Analytics applications, which are typically multiplexed modules interacting between data and specific processing tools acting thereon, such as statistical analysis and simulation, optimization, graphing and HTML/LaTeX report generation, etc., ...\n\n\nWe take a look at some available scripting systems used in combination with constraint processing technology for application orchestration, making a note of their specific features, and discussing their pros and cons.\u00a0 We also underline software engineering and maintenance issues faced when scripting constrained optimization. The question we seek to answer is, given the state of the art in declarative programming language design, is it possible to improve current scripting technology to be as concise and declarative as possible?\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nHassan A\u00eft-Kaci holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania (1984), and a Research Director Habilitation from University of Paris 7 (1990) also in CS.

Marc built a machine that balanced on one leg. Having less courage, Ivan built a machine that used six legs to avoid the balance problem. Marc demonstrated that balance is relatively easy and went on to build many more walking machines. Ivan's shorter attention span led him to abandon legged machines in favor of work on digital computing systems. \n\n\nMarc and Ivan will recount in words and pictures the fun they enjoyed with robots at CMU and elsewhere. They will end with a discussion about drawing inspiration from natural systems. The vast difference between the components found in natural systems and the components available for robots or computers limit our ability to draw inspiration from nature. Man-made systems must differ from natural systems. Those very differences provide central advantages and weaknesses.\n\n\nWith introduction by: Raj Reddy\n\n    \n  \n        \nPoster    \n  \n    Keywords:     \nRI/SCS DLS", "Time": "2016-04-14 12:00:00-04:00", "URL": "https://www.scs.cmu.edu/calendar/thu-2016-04-14-1200/teruko-yata-memorial-lecture-robotics", "University": "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tags": "", "Venue": "Gates&Hillman Centers"}, {"Topic": "Real-Time 3D Graphics from the Ground Up    ", "Speaker": "TBD", "Description": "Talks    \n  \n        \nReal-Time 3D Graphics from the Ground Up    \n  \n        \nWednesday, April 27, 2016 - \n8:00pm to 9:00pm    \n  \n        \n5421\u00a0    \n  \n        \nWean Hall    \n  \n        \n\n\n[View Map]\n    \n  \n    Abstract:     \n\n\nRay-tracers can draw beautiful, detailed computer-generated scenes, but they can take hours (or days!) to draw one frame.
